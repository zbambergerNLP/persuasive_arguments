<title>CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.</title>

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="6">I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right.</claim>

<premise type="pathos" id="9">Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.</premise>

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="10">Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty</premise>, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="11">such leaders are given a free hand</claim>.
On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers.
<premise type="logos" id="12">Wouldn't restricting "free speech" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?</premise>

<premise type="logos" id="13">Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash</premise>, but <premise type="logos" id="14">do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate</premise>.

As other's said, who gets to decide what these bad ideologies are.
Here's a substitution using your syntax, but modified details.

 &gt; Zero tolerance, whatever it takes.
<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="24">Schools should educate children on the dangers of jewish zionism</claim> and <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="25">their poison should be kept out of the minds of children</claim>.
<premise type="pathos" id="26">Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination.</premise>
In a highly connected online era, <premise type="pathos" id="27">it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="28">When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem.</premise>
<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="29">The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough.</claim>

Now, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="30">this is obviously extreme</claim>, but <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="31">you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness</claim>.

&gt; But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers ? Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.

&gt; I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives. However this isn't about being just a bit conservative. It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.
