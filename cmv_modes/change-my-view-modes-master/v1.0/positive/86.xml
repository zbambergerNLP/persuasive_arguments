<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0">Ive seen a lot of animated movies in my life but in my opinion they dont stand up to the Brave Little Toaster.</claim>
<premise type="logos" id="1">The animation is very solid for being made in the 1980`s and I absolutely love the inanimate objects journey to try and find their master.</premise>
<premise type="logos" id="2">One very tense scene for me was when the vacuum cleaner was trying to cross the canyon.</premise>
However whenever people bring up animated movies they never bring up the Brave Little Toaster.
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="3">I feel like this masterpiece is largely unappreciated by a majority of people in favor of other animated movies.</claim>

<claim type="interpretation" id="4">Reddit I think the Brave Little Toaster needs some more attention and some more love.</claim>

<premise type="logos" id="5">The Brave Little Toaster is rated "Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes, and came fairly close to winning the Sundance Film Festival in 1987.</premise>
<claim type="interpretation" id="6">The reason it is doesn't have attention now is because it didn't get attention back in the day.</claim>
<premise type="pathos" id="7">The movie was not widely released in theaters because they never found a distributor for it.</premise>

<premise type="logos" id="8">So most of us who saw it did so in comparatively limited TV showings, or picked up a VHS tape.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="9">It wasn't a made for TV movie, but that's what ended up happening to it.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="10">It has massively outsized footprint for how easy it is to find and view.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="11">Those who worked on it went on to do great things, and those who stumbled across it remember it.</premise>

So, in conclusion, <claim type="interpretation" id="12">The Brave Little Toaster isn't underrated as it is rated very highly,</claim> <premise type="logos_pathos" id="13">but it is obscure and can be a hard sell because key elements haven't aged well.</premise>

Holy Crap I never knew it only went straight to VHS.
That does explain a lot which kinda makes me sad it never got the loving from a massive portion of people like Iron Giant.
Maybe a rerelease on Netflix will reignite the fire of the Brave Little Toaster.

btw Um you get a delta for proving me wrong and that the movie was loved by the people but had very little in terms of distribution &#8710;
