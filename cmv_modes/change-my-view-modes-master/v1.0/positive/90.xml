I've noticed that nearly everyone in Washington is extremely old. <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="1">I have always thought that that was a bad thing</claim>, because of a few reasons: <premise type="logos" id="2">1. if you are already old, then the long-term consequences of your decisions probably won't happen until after you are gone, but will be horrible for all of us that are still around,</premise> 2.
<premise type="logos" id="3">if you are already retired, then you wouldn't know what it is like for a working person today, especially someone struggling to live paycheck-to-paycheck</premise>.

TL;DR: <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="4">old people shouldn't be in politics</claim> because <premise type="logos" id="5">the consequences of their decisions won't affect them</premise>, and <premise type="logos" id="6">they don't understand what the circumstances of today are</premise>.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="7">Some of your criticisms are definitely valid</claim>.
However, <claim type="interpretation" id="8">older people often have more varied or extensive life experiences to draw on, and do not generally make decisions in a vacuum</claim>.

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="9">For example, imagine a relatively long (30+ years) period of peace</premise>.
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="10">All of a sudden, war is a possibility</premise>. <premise type="logos_pathos" id="11">I would like my decision-making body to have at least a few people who might have had prior experience with a war</premise>.

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="12">Additionally, when you elect someone, like your senator, you're not just electing them, you're also electing their entire staff</premise>.
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="13">The senator might not have direct experience of what it's like to be a working person today, but does that matter as long as they have someone who can explain it to them in such a way that they understand and accept it</premise>?

Although <claim type="interpretation" id="14">it's highly unlikely that there would be a long period without conflict</claim>, <claim type="interpretation" id="15">I can see how something similar could happen</claim>.
However, <claim type="interpretation" id="16">it's not like the previous generation's knowledge would have disappeared</claim> <premise type="logos" id="17">there are thousands of guides and essays about every topic</premise>.

<claim type="agreement" id="18">sure</claim>, but <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="19">guides and essays are not necessarily the same as personal experience</claim>.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="20">I was using that point to support the more general statement that older people often have a breadth and depth of experience that younger people may or may not have</claim>, and <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="21">that is useful for decision making in a political context</claim>.

<claim type="interpretation" id="22">I guess we will always need first-hand experience when odd situations come up</claim>. 
I'll give you a delta in a bit when I'm on not on mobile.
