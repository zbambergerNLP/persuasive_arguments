<premise type="logos" id="0">For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities</premise>; <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="1">IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population</claim>.

<premise type="logos" id="2">With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s).</premise>
<claim type="interpretation" id="3">A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting.</claim>
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="4">I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child.</claim>(<premise type="logos_pathos" id="5">maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below</premise>.)

<claim type="interpretation" id="6">I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children</claim>.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="7">One of the largest predictors for success appears to be not being poor.</claim>

How would you account for that?
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="8">It seems like fining poor people has some potential negative effects... on the children.</claim>

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="9">It wouldn't be a fine</claim>, <premise type="logos" id="10">since it would only be a suspension of "assistance" anyway</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="11">And poverty is a formidable obstacle but many, many people come from poverty to be wildly successful.</premise>
<claim type="disagreement" id="12">That cannot be a blanket excuse for poor academic performance.</claim>
<claim type="interpretation" id="13">I believe the fulcrum of a child's development has always been, and will always be the parent(a living, mentally capable set of or just one parent).</claim>

<claim type="agreement" id ="14a"> Yeah</claim>, but <claim type="interpretation" id="14">my point is that giving money to people that have successful children is going, ultimately, to lead to giving money to people that already have money, and withholding it from ones that don't</claim>.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="15">Unless you make the reward high enough to overcome the *reasons* that poor parents are less involved (<premise type="logos" id="15a">e.g. they don't have time because they are having to work 2 jobs just to support the children</premise>), it's not going to solve the problem.</claim>
And <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="16">that's going to be very expensive</claim>.

Furthermore, <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="17">there's a more fundamental *reason* that poor parents are poorer at helping their children</claim>... <premise type="pathos" id="18">they're statistically dumber than richer people</premise>.
<premise type="pathos" id="19">Ignorance might be the cause, of course, rather than just lack of intrinsic intelligence</premise>.

<claim type="interpretation" id="20">It would seem that a better approach would be to pay parents to attend training on how to be better parents, rather than rewarding the ones that have just happened to figure it out on their own</claim>.

But honestly, <claim type="interpretation" id="21">I think you're just being naive about actual statistical variation in native intelligence</claim>.
<premise type="logos" id="22">There's really no reason to believe that every person has exactly the same potential to succeed well in school</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="23">A simpler explanation is that native intelligence is probably normally distributed, like almost every other trait people possess</premise>.

Edit: tried to award you the delta.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="24">Native intelligence is the challenge.</claim>
I won't delve into how this has infected my view, but <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="25">I will say that it ties into why I think a moneyless society would over time revert to fiat currency</claim>.
<premise type="logos" id="26">Some people can do some thing's better than others</premise>...thanks.
<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="27">Nice exercise</claim>.

Edit: there we go!
