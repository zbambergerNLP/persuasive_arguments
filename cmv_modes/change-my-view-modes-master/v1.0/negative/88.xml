Title is mostly to get attention, and I'm working from a specific set of assumptions.
My argument is as follows:

1) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0">The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none</claim>

1a) <premise type="logos_pathos" id="1">Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products</premise>

2) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="2">The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand</claim>

3) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="3">Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.</claim>

4) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="4">A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.</claim>

4a) <premise type="logos_pathos" id="5">Since the majority of farms are large factory farms</premise>, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="6">I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare.</claim> **
However**:

5) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="7">Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms</claim> but <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="8">helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing</claim>, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="9">which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.</claim>

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="10">My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers</claim>, and <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="11">that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.</claim>
Moreover, <premise type="pathos" id="12">this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.</premise>
<premise type="logos" id="13">Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)</premise>

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="14">A lot (dunno %) vegetarians/vegans see killing animals for food is fundamentally unethical.</claim>
So <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="15">they are not doing it for better state of animal welfare in farms</claim>.
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="16">I personally don't have a problem with animals being killed humanely,</premise> so <premise type="logos_pathos" id="17">if I become vegetarian it would be about welfare</premise>.
But that's me.
But <claim type="agreement" id="18">I agree with you that becoming vegetarian just for that is not very helpful for welfare</claim>.
I just see people's reasoning.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="19">sure, but as i've mentioned several times, that's not the point of this particular CMV post.</claim>
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="20">The point is that responsible carnivory is better for general livestock welfare than veg*</claim>

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="21">Another strong pro-veg point is that meat production is really bad for environment.</claim>
