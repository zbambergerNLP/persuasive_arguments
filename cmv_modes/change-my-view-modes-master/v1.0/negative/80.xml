<OP author="runescapethug">

<premise type="" id="0">There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="1">Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion</premise>.
<claim type="disagreement" id="2">These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up</claim>.
<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="3">Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million</claim>.
<claim type="interpretation" id="4">One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems</claim>.
<premise type="ethos_logos" id="5">Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="6">America's innovation and education rankings would be lower</premise>.
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="7">Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around</premise>.
(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around.
Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)
**Was view changed?**
<claim type="interpretation" id="8">Its a complicated issue</claim>.
<premise type="logos" id="9">Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population</premise>?
<premise type="logos" id="10">Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange</premise>, meaning that <claim type="disagreement" id="11">it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive</claim>?
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="12">Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics</premise>?
-(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-
(Side thought: <claim type="interpretation" id="13">Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children</claim>.
<claim type="interpretation" id="14">Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons</claim>, but <premise type="logos_pathos" id="15">surely its a significant number</premise>, so <premise type="logos_pathos" id="16">how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower</premise>?
<claim type="agreement" id="17">This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value</claim>.
Conclusion: <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="18">Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding.</claim> *no that isn't a serious sentiment,
i'm just saying, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="19">this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point*</claim> )
Then there is the next question.
<claim type="interpretation" id="20">Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems</claim>, or <claim type="interpretation" id="21">would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit</claim>?
Similar: <premise type="logos_pathos" id="22">An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus</premise>, but <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="23">in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not</claim>.
<claim type="interpretation" id="24">Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one</claim>.
<claim type="interpretation" id="25">This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country</claim>.
<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="26">Modern technology like the internet must be considered</claim>.
Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite.
I am now confused and lost.
**EDIT:**
I'll be without internet for a few days.
I may end up returning and responding more but it won't be anytime soon.
This was my first post to CMV.
I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here.
I also see a few times where I got redundant.
Thank you all for your arguments.
This is a very critical place, I hope to learn how to better use it and come here more often.
I feel I could learn a lot here.

<premise type="ethos_logos" id="31">(should be noted that India has less internet users and that the availibilty of the internet may play a huge part in people with less wealth being able to be innovative,</premise> so <claim type="interpretation" id="32">with the internet taken into account, your answer could be true)</claim> [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users)
