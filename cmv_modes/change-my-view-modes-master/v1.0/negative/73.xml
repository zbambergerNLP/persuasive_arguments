<claim type="disagreement" id="2">2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.</claim>

<claim type="interpretation" id="3">3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.</claim>

Stop supporting it how?
<premise type="pathos" id="7">As in never buying meat again</premise>, <premise type="pathos" id="8">even as you know that doing so will not have any impact on the meat industry whatsoever</premise>, and <premise type="pathos" id="9">won't make even an ounce of difference in the lives of animals?</premise>
<premise type="logos" id="10">What's the point?</premise>
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="11">If I stop eating meat today, it won't make any difference whatsoever and won't save even a single animal's life.</claim>

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="12">The only way to make real change in industries like this is to organize and participate in a boycott on a wide-scale level</claim>, and/or <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="13">to petition the government to make regulation changes.</claim>
