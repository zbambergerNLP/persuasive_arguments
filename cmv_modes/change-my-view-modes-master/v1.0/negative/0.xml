So recently I've seen a lot of posts condemning Islam as a violent religion or a sexist religion.
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0">I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.</claim>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="1">For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists.</premise>

So, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="2">my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way.</claim> <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="3">I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.</claim>

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="2a"> The fact I don't fear an Amish flying a plane into my office tower or a Jain blowing up my bus makes me doubt that religions have no inherent features that influence people's actions. </premise>

<claim type="interpretation" id="2b"> The Amish and the Vedic religions in general haven't been demonized to the same extent as Muslims have. </claim> 
<premise type="logos" id="2c"> I'm far morel likely in general to be killed by a Christian than a Muslim </premise> , but <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="2d"> that doesn't mean I should fear Christians. </claim>

<premise type="logos" id="2e"> So, if you're measuring by fear people feel, you're more likely to find the source of that in the mainstream media than you will in religion. </premise>

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="7">This has nothing to do with the religion but by what we are surrounded by.</claim>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="8">I probably am more likely to be killed by a muslim than a christian *because of their religion*.</premise> Although the odds have little to do regarding trust or feelings.

It's an issue of rate, and at that point, I'd like to see stats. 
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="8b"> I'm not going to take an emotional appeal when considering whether or not a religion has dangerous components. </claim>

What particular aspects do you find toxic?

<premise type="logos" id="9">That is due to statistics, not to scripture or religious property.</premise>
<premise type="logos" id="10">you are more likely to be killed by a heart attack than by a christian</premise>, <claim type="interpretation" id="11">this doesn't say anything about christianity</claim>.

&gt; I'm not going to take an emotional appeal when considering whether or not a religion has dangerous components.

Emotional?
<claim type="agreement" id="12">I am just looking at the outcome of people following the religion.</claim>
Facts.

&gt; What particular aspects do you find toxic?

<premise type="logos" id="13">The fanatism and radical actions it allows and encourages.</premise>
Do you want quran quotes or something?
