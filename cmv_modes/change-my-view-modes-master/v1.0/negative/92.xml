<premise type="logos" id="0">According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="1">Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature.</premise>

<premise type="pathos" id="5">An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg.</premise>
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="6">The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist.</claim>
