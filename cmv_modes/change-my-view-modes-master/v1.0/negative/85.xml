<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0">Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.</claim>

&gt; There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future? 
&gt; It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man. 
&gt; The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species.

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="2a">I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself.</claim>

<claim type="disagreement" id="3a">I do disagree with Gade a little bit.</claim>
<claim type="interpretation" id="3b">I don't think it would kill everybody, </claim> but <premise type="logos_pathos" id="3c">the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes.</premise>
<claim type="interpretation" id="3">I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much.</claim>

<premise type="" id="4">The reason that the end of our current economic paradigm won't be followed by a new one is because there is nothing for us to do after the machines are doing all of the service jobs we are currently losing.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="5">Machines don't have money either so they won't bother buying services from us.</premise>
<premise type="logos" id="6">Cryptocurrency may help a little because it would allow servers to be able to buy and sell things</premise>, but <premise type="logos" id="7">once they can administrate their own systems what is the use of humans.</premise>
<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="8">What would be stopping them is the people already in the commutes they would try to go to.</claim>
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="9">If the urban folk get rid of the rural folk the urban folk will just die due to their lack of skills.</claim>
<claim type="agreement" id="10">They couldn't just survive together</claim> because <premise type="logos_pathos" id="11">the ecosystem will not be able to sustain the amount of people</premise>.
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="12">The rural folk can survive without the urban folk</claim> but <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="13">their standard of living will plummet due to lack of infrastructure.</claim>
