So recently I've seen a lot of posts condemning Islam as a violent religion or a sexist religion.
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0" rel="agreement" ref="title">I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.</claim>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="1" rel="support" ref="0">For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists.</premise>

So, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="2" rel="agreement" ref="title">my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way.</claim> <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="3" rel="agreement" ref="2">I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.</claim>

It's an issue of rate, and at that point, I'd like to see stats.

Emotional?
<claim type="interpretation" id="12" rel="agreement" ref="8b">I am just looking at the outcome of people following the religion.</claim>
Facts.

&gt; What particular aspects do you find toxic?

<premise type="logos" id="13" rel="undercutter" ref="8c">The fanatism and radical actions it allows and encourages.</premise>
Do you want quran quotes or something?
