CMV: If you're able, European and subscribe even loosely to European values, you should be on the Ukrainian border, driving back Russians

Obviously I'm not there right now, but I'm curious if anyone can put my mind at ease that I shouldn't be.

Feels to me as if Putin senses weakness in the Western world , with the US and Europe driven farther apart by issues like privacy and human rights, the US withdrawing as a dominant force in geopolitics, because people in and outside of the US are fed up with the US policing the world.
His territorial pissings seems to be meant to elbow some room for himself on the geopolitical stage, in other words gaining power.
Putin is a totalitarian, oppressive, ruthless man, and allowing him to gain more power will affect all of us.

What if you are more useful as a negotiator working towards a peaceful resolution to the conflict than you are as a freedom fighter.
Being able doesn't imply you are going to be helpful on that front.
I guess I count that towards 'being on the Ukrainian border, driving back Russians' .
Whatever way you think you can make yourself useful.
It can be fighting, negotiating, cooking, doctoring..
Then I have no argument.
Your original post had a very different tone to it however.
Might want to change it from "you should be on the Ukranian border, driving back Russians".
