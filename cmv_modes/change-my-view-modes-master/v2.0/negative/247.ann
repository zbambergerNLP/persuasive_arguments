A9	Type3 T9 pathos
T10	premise 887 1030	The main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.
A10	Type3 T10 logos_pathos
T11	claim 1031 1206	Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.
A11	Type2 T11 evaluation_emotional
T12	claim 1207 1381	The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.
A12	Type2 T12 evaluation_rational
T13	premise 1382 1539	They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil).

T17	claim 1943 2017	This is much more important than it's faithfulness to the source material.

T18	claim 2018 2076	I believe this is true for all adaptations, not just LOTR.
A18	Type2 T18 evaluation_emotional
T19	claim 2128 2222	How could such a subjective view as the superiority of a cut of three films be argued against?
A19	Type2 T19 evaluation_rational
T20	premise 2223 2352	I prefer the pacing in the shorter cut and the director agrees with me is hardly something that can be rigorously argued against.
A20	Type3 T20 ethos_logos
T21	claim 2354 2407	I would argue that the better one depends on context.
A21	Type2 T21 evaluation_rational
T22	premise 2408 2585	I enjoyed the theatrical cut when I first watched it but the extended was probably better when I had a lot of free time and wanted to watch a favourite movie in a different way.
