CMV: Religion is not violent or not violent, its followers are.

So recently I've seen a lot of posts condemning Islam as a violent religion or a sexist religion.
I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.
For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists.

So, my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way. I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.


This is like saying "Guns don't kill people, people kill people."
This might be true , but the gun certainty played a big part.


Okay , but even if religion did motivate people to kill, it doesn't provide the means to kill, only the motivation.
However, assuming that a gun provides the motivation, it also provides the tool to kill someone with.

That being said, I'm not convinced that either motivates people to kill, and one gives the tools to kill with and the other doesn't .
This analogy falls short for me.


Religion gives them the psychological tools to justify to themselves that killing is ok.
Without that, they wouldn't be able to kill.
So while the person is ultimately responsible, like the gun, religion played a part.


Hm, that sounds more like the motivation though.
