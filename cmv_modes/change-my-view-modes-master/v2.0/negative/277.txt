CMV: The Call of Duty franchise is extremely overrated and overhyped.

I'd like to start off by saying that the CoD games are good games in their own right, though they are extremely overhyped .
One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.
There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same.
Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.

Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.
There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.

Can you name at least one game that has spectacular change/s or uniqueness among its predecessors and genre?
A few:

-Elder Scrolls

-GTA

-Dragon Age (With Inquisition)

-Metroid Prime

-Mass Effect

The list goes on.
