Title is mostly to get attention, and I'm working from a specific set of assumptions.
My argument is as follows:

1) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0" rel="agreement" ref="title">The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none</claim>

1a) <premise type="logos_pathos" id="1" rel="support" ref="0">Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products</premise>

2) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="2" rel="agreement" ref="title">The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand</claim>

3) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="3" rel="agreement" ref="title">Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.</claim>

4) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="4" rel="support" ref="title">A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.</claim>

4a) <premise type="logos_pathos" id="5" rel="support" ref="6">Since the majority of farms are large factory farms</premise>, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="6">I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare.</claim> **
However**:

5) <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="7" rel="agreement" ref="title">Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms</claim> but <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="8">helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing</claim>, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="9">which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.</claim>

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="10" rel="agreement" ref="title">My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers</claim>, and <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="11" rel="agreement" ref="title">that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.</claim>
Moreover, <premise type="pathos" id="12" rel="support" ref="10">this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.</premise>
<premise type="logos" id="13" rel="support" ref="11">Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)</premise>

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="14" rel="undercutter" ref="6">It really depends on how you view animal welfare.</claim>
<premise type="pathos" id="15" rel="support" ref="14">I think most vegetarians see killing and eating an animal as wrong regardless of how good the conditions it lives in are.</premise>

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="16" rel="agreement" ref="14">I guess that this comes from my utilitarian-in-most-cases ethics.</claim>
<claim type="interpretation" id="17" rel="undercutter" ref="title">I believe that small-medium improvements over large scales, such as an entire market, are better than large improvements at tiny scales.</claim>

Moreover, <claim type="disagreement" id="18" rel="rebuttal" ref="title">this CMV is not about "veganism and vegetarianism are bad"</claim> <claim type="interpretation" id="19" rel="rebuttal" ref="title">it's about "eating meat responsibly is better for animal welfare than abstaining from eating meat"</claim>
