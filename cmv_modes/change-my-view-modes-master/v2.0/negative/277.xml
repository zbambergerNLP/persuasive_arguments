<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0">I'd like to start off by saying that the CoD games are good games in their own right,</claim> though <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="1" rel="partial_attack" ref="0">they are extremely overhyped </claim>.
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="2" rel="support" ref="1">One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="3" rel="support" ref="2">There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="4" rel="support" ref="2">Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.</premise>

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="5" rel="support" ref="1" >Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.</premise>
<premise type="logos" id="6" rel="support" ref="5">There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.</premise>
