<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="6" rel="agreement" ref="title">I understand why politics use this slogan</claim>, <premise type="logos" id="7" rel="support" ref="6">because they are trying to get americans to vote for them</premise>, but <premise type="logos" id="8" rel="support" rid="b" ref="6">this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations</premise>.

<claim type="interpretation" id="15" rel="agreement" ref="14">Patriotism is really just this belief.</claim>

<premise type="logos" id="15a" rel="support" ref="15b">I would define patriotism quite simply as supporting one's country, but not *necessarily* disparaging others.</premise>
<claim type="interpretation" id="15b">Therefore I would say that the antithesis of patriotism is not having a global perspective, but is in fact selfishness</claim>.

<claim type="interpretation" id="18">Whether you support immigration or not, so long as you are supporting what you believe is best for your nation, you are still acting patriotically</claim>, and <claim type="interpretation" id="19">even if you decide to support another nation you can still be acting patriotically as well so long as you support your nation too</claim>.

	line 8 original:
	<claim type="interpretation" id="1">Saying these people shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse,</claim> <premise type="logos_pathos" id="2" rel="support" ref="0">because they were born on a different side of a line</premise>, and <premise type="logos_pathos" id="3" rel="support" ref="0">americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on</premise>. 
	line 11 premise (or nothing) -> claim because clear point of view
	line 10, 11, 12: all three concessions
	line 19 claim -> premise because the first sentence substantiates the second sentence
	line 20 premise -> claim because of 'therefore' and clearer point of view than the preceding sentence that serves as premise
	line 21 after 'but' remove premise because claim extends to the selfishness part
	line 22, id 18, 19: both premise -> claim

	Q: like 93 negative, it seems like the commenter gives a sound argument, though we have no way of knowing how OP responds to the last comment. Is delta not given for sure?
