CMV: Freedom of speech is being taken too far

In the last few weeks we've had two huge events happen in the world, both of which were caused by matters relating to "freedom of speech." The first being the hacking of Sony over The Interview, and today the shooting at the offices of a satirical magazine in Paris.
I certainly value our free speech but to me there is a clear line between exercising your first amendment right ( ( Satirical cartoons of prophets, assassinating leaders, etc ).

Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.

Sure , but that doesn't mean we condone the bully's actions and don't punish the bullies for acting .
We want to live in a world without bullies, whether those bullies act on behalf of beliefs, religions, countries, or even out own governments .
Complete freedom in the expression of any idea, offensive or not, is a major element of that world .

If you want to protect the freedom to speak for any of us, you have to protect the freedom to speak for all of us .


I certainly agree with your points - I didn't mean to imply that I was only for **some** freedom of speech .
I just think lately there's been a lot of antagonistic material being published and everyone cries freedom of speech when certain groups get upset .

Why can't America be the bigger person and say "Ok, we won't publish certain types of material, not because we're afraid of you but because we respect your views."
Is that so hard?
