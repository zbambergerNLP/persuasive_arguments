CMV: Assuming there is no afterlife, then life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die.

*Note: Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post.
I am not religious.
Thank you.
ALSO: By "meaningless," I mean "meaningless" to the person who is doing the dying.
To the person who is alive and who will then die, life is meaningless.

CMV.
Assuming there is no afterlife , life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die .
Death is the great eraser .
Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory .
It is comparable to that, too .

It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die .
Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness .
Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing .
To me, it is as if my life had never happened .

I'll put it another way.
Imagine the time before you were born .
Have you remembered it yet?
Of course not .
You didn't exist .
This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth .
When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness , and I return to it permanently . I might as well have never lived .

To anticipate a few responses:

(1) Helping others doesn't matter .
They will die too .
And then their descendants will die, on and on and on , until eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death .
Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me , assuming they all die , then my life is still pointless and meaningless .
For I will be dead and won't know what I did , and once they die, they won't know either .

(2) Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal."
I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness .
Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame .

(3) Enjoying the moment is possible , but doesn't make life have a point .
For once I die, all memories and all point is gone .

Please change my view from this depressing sentiment.


What if time itself is an illusion, and we really do live forever?

Consider a novel.
As you read through the novel, you go from page to page, eventually reaching the end .
But does the novel stop existing just because you finished the book?
Or does the book continue to exist, with it's words, chapters, stories, characters, and lives intact?

"Now" is *the page you are reading at this moment* .
But just because there are pages you've already read, or pages you have yet to read, doesn't mean those pages don't exist .
And all those pages will continue to exist, even after you've finished your book .


Most interesting point so far.
Thank you!


And this view is supported by physics and what we know of it .
Time isn't "real" in the same sense that we experience it .
We are simply at one point along a path, and that's the "now" .
All the other points in time exist as much as the current point in time, however .

Let's say I travel from home to the grocery store : I leave my apartment, go down the elevator, out on the street, past the cigar shop, past the empty parking lot, and finally to the store . *
Now* I'm at the store, but did my apartment, my elevator, the street I walked on, the cigar shop, and the empty parking lot cease to exist simply because I'm not there *right now*?
Of course not .
