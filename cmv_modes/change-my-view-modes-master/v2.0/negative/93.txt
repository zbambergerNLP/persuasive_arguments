CMV The EGG came first before the chicken.

According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken .
Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature.
Let's call it X.
Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken , but at some point it does .
An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg.
The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist.
Am I wrong?

PS I'm playing laser tag soon so I will respond in 20ish minutes.


The modern domestic chicken is a hybrid of a red and grey junglefowl.
The egg produced by cross-breading the two species resulted in the first chicken.
Therefore, you are correct in saying that the egg came first , but your explanation is incorrect .


Interesting.
I didn't know that.
You may have just solved thus debacle.
Where in the world did the chicken first live?


It's generally thought they originated in Asia -- India or Southeast Asia, most likely.


Cool.
Thanks
