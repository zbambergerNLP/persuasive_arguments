CMV: The theatrical cuts of Lord of the Rings are superior to the extended cuts and should be considered the definitive versions.

I'll preface this by saying I'm a fan of both the books and movies.
I like them both for different reasons , but gun to my head I probably slightly prefer the films.

(The hobbit movies can S my D though.)

IMO, the extended cuts seriously throw off the pacing of the films.
When watching the theatrical cuts, I get swept into the story.
When watching the extended cuts, I get distracted, and reminded that I'm watching a movie.
They break the fourth wall, if you will.

Peter Jackson agrees with me:

&gt; The theatrical versions are the definitive versions. I regard the extended cuts as being a novelty for the fans that really want to see the extra material.

&gt; I felt that I was sacrificing pacing and momentum in order for these scenes to go in.

The main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.
Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.
The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.
They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil).

Basically, I'm glad Jackson opted to make excellent **movies,** instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a **book,** and I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard.

Books and movies are not the same , and in general, **the more an adaptation respects the inherent differences between the various media it's adapting to and from, the better the final product will be.**
This is much more important than it's faithfulness to the source material.
I believe this is true for all adaptations, not just LOTR.
Feel free to C my V on this larger point as well.

How could such a subjective view as the superiority of a cut of three films be argued against?
I prefer the pacing in the shorter cut and the director agrees with me is hardly something that can be rigorously argued against.

I would argue that the better one depends on context.
I enjoyed the theatrical cut when I first watched it but the extended was probably better when I had a lot of free time and wanted to watch a favourite movie in a different way.

I'm sure we can find a way to argue about movies ;)
