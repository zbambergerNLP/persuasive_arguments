T1	main_claim 0 80	CMV: Eugenics isn't all that bad... And we don't even have to kill anyone for it
A1	Type1 T1 evaluation_emotional
T2	claim 146 188	Intelligence is at least partially genetic
A2	Type2 T2 evaluation_rational
T3	premise 193 225	therefore passed down by parents
A3	Type3 T3 pathos
T4	claim 398 418	I'm against killing.
A4	Type2 T4 evaluation_emotional
T5	premise 462 635	For example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.
A5	Type3 T5 pathos
T6	premise 636 765	Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.
A6	Type3 T6 pathos
T7	premise 767 909	So someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring.
A7	Type3 T7 logos_pathos
T8	premise 910 996	The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it.
A8	Type3 T8 logos_pathos
T9	premise 997 1094	A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.
A9	Type3 T9 logos_pathos
T10	premise 1096 1203	Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.
A10	Type3 T10 logos_pathos
T11	claim 1205 1254	This would eventually make the human race smarter
A11	Type2 T11 interpretation
T12	premise 1261 1321	therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race.
A12	Type3 T12 pathos
T13	premise 1323 1404	I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do
A13	Type3 T13 pathos
T14	premise 1444 1508	I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	claim 1531 1627	Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit
A15	Type2 T15 interpretation
T16	premise 1640 1790	If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one
A16	Type3 T16 logos_pathos
T17	premise 1794 1901	Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded?
A17	Type3 T17 pathos
T18	premise 1905 2042	maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.
A18	Type3 T18 pathos
T19	premise 2044 2098	Much better than "Kill off those with IQ less than 80"
A19	Type3 T19 ethos_pathos
T20	premise 2100 2139	I wouldn't mind a smarter human race...
A20	Type3 T20 pathos
T21	claim 2828 2872	this is really the main reason not to do it.
A21	Type2 T21 disagreement
T22	premise 2873 2953	How do you prevent people from having more than the allotted number of children?
A22	Type3 T22 logos
T23	premise 2954 2975	Forced sterilization?
A23	Type3 T23 logos_pathos
T24	premise 2976 2993	Forced abortions?
A24	Type3 T24 logos_pathos
T25	premise 2994 3001	Prison?
A25	Type3 T25 logos_pathos
T26	premise 3002 3008	Fines?
A26	Type3 T26 logos_pathos
T27	premise 3009 3034	Taking away the children?
A27	Type3 T27 logos_pathos
T28	premise 3035 3101	All of these are terrible options, and there aren't any good ones.
A28	Type3 T28 pathos
T29	claim 3202 3388	that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.
