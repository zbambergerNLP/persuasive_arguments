CMV The EGG came first before the chicken.

According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken .
Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature.
Let's call it X.
Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken , but at some point it does .
An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg.
The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist.
Am I wrong?

PS I'm playing laser tag soon so I will respond in 20ish minutes.


If we are being really technical, we can confidently say that the egg came first.

The chicken, as far as we know came into existence around [2500-2100 BC.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#Origins)

Egg bearing animals, however, seem to be [as old as the dinosuars] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_egg)

From this, we can conclude that the egg came first.

While the question doesn't specifically say a chicken egg, I think that argument is kind of silly.


well... yeah.
My comment was a silly way to point out a flaw in your post.
It wasn't an actual argument.
