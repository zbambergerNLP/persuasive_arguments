CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare

Title is mostly to get attention, and I'm working from a specific set of assumptions.
My argument is as follows:

1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products

2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand

3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.

4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.

4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms , I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. **
However**:

5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing , which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.

My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers , and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.
Moreover, this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.
Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)


I take some issue with assumption #1.
Dramatic societal changes have happened multiple times throughout history.
They are gradual and at times may seem impossible to many , but they do happen .

The larger issue is that you are somehow concluding that someone choosing to go vegan gives more demand to large factory farms.
You are correct that it may reduce the demand for meat from *slightly* less cruel farms , but it also takes demand away from the larger farms .
Going vegan means fewer animals suffer on small farms and fewer animals suffer on factory farms, not that fewer animals suffer on small farms and more animals suffer on factory farms.


Someone going vegan and someone becoming an ethical carnivore reduce demand for factory-farmed meat by exactly the same amount (1 person).
The ethical carnivore just happens to *also* increase demand for responsibly-grown meat.


&gt; Someone going vegan and someone becoming an ~~ethical~~ *slightly less unethical* carnivore reduce demand for factory-farmed meat by exactly the same amount (1 person). The ~~ethical~~ *slightly less unethical* carnivore just happens to also increase demand for responsibly-grown meat.

I fixed your statement.
Someone who eats "happy" meat isn't helping animals.
They are simply supporting farms that are somewhat less cruel.


Since, as you stated in your first post of this discussion, you reject my first assertion, I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree on that one.
