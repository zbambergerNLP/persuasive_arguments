CMV: Any given aspect of the legal system should be short and simple enough that an average high school graduate could fully memorize it

CLARIFICATIONS BASED ON ANTICIPATED CONFUSION:

(1.) I'm **not** saying simple enough that **all** high school students **should** memorize them; I'm saying simple enough that almost anyone could, if they were struck by the impulse to make that unusually large commitment, do so .
Like, most people don't memorize all of Romeo and Juliet.
But most people, I think, if they really wanted to, **could.**

(2.)
I'm not interested in hearing any arguments that are based in any way on what the laws are, right now, except by way of comparison.
This includes the constitution.
Seriously -- this isn't what I want to argue here, but I'm 100% on board with trashing the US constitution and starting from scratch with new documents, so appealing to the constitution is not on topic.

I'm not a fan of extreme simplification, but I think the American legal system has gotten out of hand in complexity.
I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them.

Ideally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category's laws.

By categories, I mean things like: criminal law; the tax code; any given category of regulation by profession (medical, construction, IT, and so on).

I'd be fine with memorizing all the laws being a feat on par with memorizing the Bible; but it should be well within the average citizen's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it.

Edit 9:55: CLARIFICATIONS BASED ON CONFUSION THAT HAS OCCURRED:

(1.)
I am not arguing that a shorter legal code is by definition easy to understand.
I am not arguing that the average High School student should be able to achieve a lawyer's level of expertise in any given aspect.
I'm defending the memorization criterion as a way to limit the total length and vagueness of a set of laws.

EDIT 8:35 the following morning: Nobody last night since I went to bed made any points that I haven't already addressed more than once, so I'm done individually responding unless somebody comes up with something new. For the answers to all the posts since I went to bed: see anticipated clarifications 1 and 2, clarification based on actual confusion 1, [this comment,](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2qrlmm/cmv_any_given_aspect_of_the_legal_system_should/cn91esr) and literally the name of the subreddit.


Many high school graduates are complete morons.
I legal system that they could understand would be archaic.


MEMORIZE.
Not UNDERSTAND.
The point is to limit the LENGTH OF THE DOCUMENT and the VAGUENESS OF ITS BOUNDARIES.
