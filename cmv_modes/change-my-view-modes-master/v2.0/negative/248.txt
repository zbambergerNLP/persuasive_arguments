CMV: People who cheat on their spouses can and should, in some cases, be forgiven

There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact.
I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal , but in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.

There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that "sex with another person = relationship over" that I don't think hold up.

* **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end.
My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part.
Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

* **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end.
My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

* **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases , but other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. [
But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

* **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem , such as ... talking about the problem.
Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.

Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc.

Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship.
In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it .

&gt;Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

Cheating isn't just a single mistake though.
It is a series of mistakes , and each time the cheater made the "mistake," he or she was making *a conscious knowing decision to betray his or her spouse* several times in a row by the time physical cheating happens.

A "mistake" would be flirting back with the man or woman who flirts with you at a party while your spouse is away.
But to reach cheating, you have to not just flirt back, but also start touching, start kissing, start hugging, get to a private location, start undressing, and *then* start having sex.
That's no less than seven decisions one would have had to make before that person reaches sexual adultery.

Maybe, but [now we're just haggling over the price](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/300099-churchill-madam-would-you-sleep-with-me-for-five-million), or the number of mistakes.
If a partner failed to start the dishwasher before going to bed 8 times, that doesn't mean automatic breakup.

Yeah, these mistakes are more severe than a dishwasher starting , but the number of them isn't the question - the severity is.
