<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0">The options are as follows</claim>:

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="1">1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.</claim>

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="2">2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.</claim>

<claim type="interpretation" id="3">3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.</claim>

Reasoning: <premise type="logos_pathos" id="4" rel="support" ref="0">I used to follow 'option number 3', but recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values.</premise>
<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="5">I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however</claim>, so feel free to prove me wrong.

What about Option 4: <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="6" rel="undercutter" ref="0">You hate animals and you want to see them killed.</claim>

To address your last question, yes, <claim type="disagreement" id="30" rel="agreement" ref="20">the bible states that all animals were put on earth by God to serve man</claim>.
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="31" rel="agreement" ref="29">There were rules against eating certain kinds</claim>, but <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="32" rel="agreement" ref="20">overall the idea was that humans have dominion over all</claim>.
In which case, <claim type="interpretation" id="33" rel="agreement" ref="17">there is no cognitive dissonance</claim>, but <claim type="interpretation" id="34" rel="partial_attack" ref="17">this would probably fall under your 2nd line of reasoning</claim>.

&gt;I think it's fairly normal to be a speciesist. I want to make note that I'm not trying to argue from a point of naturalism in regards to what ought to be done, but that it shouldn't be that surprising when we encounter people that are that way.

<claim type="agreement" id="35" rel="agreement" ref="22">Yes, speciesism is indeed the norm</claim> and <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="36" rel="agreement" ref="22">I appreciate you taking the time to comment</claim>.

&gt;I mean hell, it's hard enough for many people to empathize with each other, and you're asking them to try to put themselves in the hooves of a cow? It's just beyond the scope for many people unless they seriously put the time in to think about it, and they've got their own lives to worry about.

<claim type="agreement" id="39" rel="agreement" ref="25">A very good reminder, thank you</claim>.
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="40" rel="agreement" ref="27">Not everyone is as obsessed with philosophy, psychology and nature as I am</claim>, <premise type="logos_pathos" id="41" rel="support" ref="40">just as I don't concern myself with keeping extremely up to date on world politics and Amnesty International petitions.</premise>

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="42" rel="undercutter" ref="25">I'd still class it as option 3 though</claim> :P
