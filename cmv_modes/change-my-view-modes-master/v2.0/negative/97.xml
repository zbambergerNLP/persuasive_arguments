<premise type="logos_pathos" id="0" rel="support" ref="title">Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="1" rel="support" ref="title" >They will care about how people respond to them</premise>, but <premise type="logos_pathos" id="2">since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity</premise>.

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="3" rel="support" ref="title">Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality</premise>, and <premise type="logos_pathos" id="4" rel="support" ref="title">people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group</premise>.
<premise type="pathos" id="5" rel="support" ref="title">Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews</premise>, and <premise type="pathos" id="6" rel="support" ref="title">any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups</premise>.

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="7" rel="support" ref="title">On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof</premise>.
<premise type="pathos" id="8" rel="support" ref="title">Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors</premise>, <premise type="pathos" id="9" rel="support" ref="title">ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="10" rel="support" ref="title">It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.</premise>

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="11" rel="agreement" ref="title">Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.</claim>

<claim type="interpretation" id="12" rel="agreement" ref="title">I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative</claim>, but <claim type="interpretation" id="13" rel="agreement" ref="title">that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site</claim>.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="14" rel="agreement" ref="title">Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.</claim>

<claim type="disagreement" id="15" rel="partial_disagreement" ref="title">I think this isn't ALWAYS true.</claim>
<premise type="logos" id="16" rel="support" ref="15">Some people aren't changed by others that easily.</premise>
And <claim type="interpretation" id="17" rel="support" rid="d" ref="15">I think your argument applies only to boards like /b/ or /pol/</claim>.
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="18" rel="support" rid="d" ref="15">If you go on 4chan right now to the /wg/ board (wallpapers) or the /vr/ board, almost everyone there is nice</premise>.
They are the boards to people with dedication and interests, though.

<claim type="interpretation" id="19" rel="undercutter" ref="18">I think those boards are bit more niche and have less users.</claim>

But <claim type="agreement" id="20" rel="partial_agreement" ref="15">I get your point</claim>, <premise type="logos" id="21" rel="support" ref="20">in my experience /vg/ has been pretty good since people in those threads generally like the games they're talking about and not just wildly pissing about</premise>.
