CMV: Swimming is the best form of exercise

While obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being , if someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique , there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming .
Swimming is:

A) cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels

B) resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added

C) low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems

D) whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)

With all that said and considered, is there any reason to choose another **single** form of exercise over swimming, other than lack of accessible facilities (EDIT: or physical inability to swim)?

Edit 2: view changed, because "best form of exercise" is actually meaningless .


For one thing, I can't swim.
I can (for the most part) bob in place well enough to keep myself from drowning, but when I add any type of movement I end up with lungs full of water.

It's not from lack of trying either.
I've had lots of swimming lessons, and I just can't catch on.

Also, you are dismissing "lack of availability" as a reason pretty easily.
That is probably one of the biggest reasons.


fair enough , though I still feel that for those who are able swimming is the best form of exercise .
i'll add physical inability to do so to the OP
