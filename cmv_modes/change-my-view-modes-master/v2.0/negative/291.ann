T2	claim 75 185	Ive seen a lot of animated movies in my life but in my opinion they dont stand up to the Brave Little Toaster.
A2	Type2 T2 evaluation_rational
T3	premise 186 324	The animation is very solid for being made in the 1980`s and I absolutely love the inanimate objects journey to try and find their master.

T4	premise 325 412	One very tense scene for me was when the vacuum cleaner was trying to cross the canyon.

T5	claim 508 620	I feel like this masterpiece is largely unappreciated by a majority of people in favor of other animated movies.
A5	Type2 T5 evaluation_rational
T6	claim 622 707	Reddit I think the Brave Little Toaster needs some more attention and some more love.
A6	Type2 T6 interpretation
T7	claim 713 928	The fact that it's underrated largely stems from the fact that by today's measure it's far from a children's movie, which unfortunately in western countries is generally the target demographic for animated features.

T8	premise 1048 1061	It's too dark

T9	premise 1068 1082	almost violent

T10	premise 1086 1169	Some examples would be, when the Flower observes it's own reflection in the toaster

T11	premise 1176 1220	dies from loneliness when the toaster leaves
A11	Type3 T11 pathos
T12	premise 1224 1330	The appliances that have their parts ripped out, are effectively a commentary on black market organ sales.

T13	premise 1333 1369	The cars singing "You're worthless."
A13	Type3 T13 logos_pathos

T15	claim 1421 1472	I grew up watching the movie, and it doesn't bug me
A15	Type2 T15 evaluation_emotional
T16	claim 1510 1658	when the alternative is Adventure Time or My Little Pony, I'm likely to think that Brave Little Toaster isn't good viewing material for kids in 2014
A16	Type2 T16 evaluation_emotional
T17	premise 1661 1751	Concepts like death or dying in children's features are incredibly out of favor right now.
A17	Type3 T17 logos
T18	claim 1752 1803	You can make arguments for something like Toy Story
A18	Type2 T18 evaluation_emotional
T19	premise 1810 1934	those franchises have been out for over 15 years, and so they get a pass from the now adults who enjoyed the movies as kids.
A19	Type3 T19 logos
T20	claim 1936 2035	There have been a great many "dark" animated movies and shows that grew to become extremely famous.
A20	Type2 T20 interpretation
T21	premise 2036 2206	If we`re using a level of "dark" of the level of Brave Little Toaster then why did things like The Iron Giant and Land Before Time get a ton of love associated with them.
A21	Type3 T21 logos
T22	premise 2223 2259	one contains a death of someones mom
A22	Type3 T22 pathos
T23	premise 2264 2353	the other almost had an entire town nuked as well as a giant death machine moving through
A23	Type3 T23 pathos
T24	claim 2356 2458	Land before Time has about 15 other movies in the franchise which make it popular, much like toy story
A24	Type2 T24 interpretation
T25	claim 2465 2543	Iron Giant doesn't really deal with much that's terribly dark or controversial
A25	Type2 T25 interpretation
T26	claim 2666 2748	I personally believe Iron Giant to be the darker film because of the war undertone
