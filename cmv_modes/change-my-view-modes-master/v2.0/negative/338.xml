<premise type="logos" id="0" rel="support" ref="title">For the sake of this thread, we'll exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities</premise>; <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="1">IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population</claim>.

<premise type="logos" id="2" rel="support" ref="title">With a healthy child, income, neighborhood, peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parent(s).</premise>
<claim type="interpretation" id="3">A child who struggles in earnest or intentionally slacks off is a direct reflection of parenting.</claim>
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="4">I am curious regarding potential for more public accountability held to parents who fail to direct their child.</claim>(<premise type="logos_pathos" id="5" rel="support" ref="4">maybe a monetary incentive derived from public tax coffers paid to parents of children who maintain a passing grade, to be withheld if child dips below</premise>.)

<claim type="interpretation" id="6">I think parents are virtually 100% responsible for producing scholastically successful children</claim>.
