<premise type="logos_pathos" id="0" rel="support" ref="title">Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="1" rel="support" ref="title" >They will care about how people respond to them</premise>, but <premise type="logos_pathos" id="2">since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity</premise>.

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="3" rel="support" ref="title">Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality</premise>, and <premise type="logos_pathos" id="4" rel="support" ref="title">people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group</premise>.
<premise type="pathos" id="5" rel="support" ref="title">Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews</premise>, and <premise type="pathos" id="6" rel="support" ref="title">any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups</premise>.

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="7" rel="support" ref="title">On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof</premise>.
<premise type="pathos" id="8" rel="support" ref="title">Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors</premise>, <premise type="pathos" id="9" rel="support" ref="title">ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="10" rel="support" ref="title">It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.</premise>

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="11" rel="agreement" ref="title">Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.</claim>

<claim type="interpretation" id="12" rel="agreement" ref="title">I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative</claim>, but <claim type="interpretation" id="13" rel="agreement" ref="title">that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site</claim>.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="14" rel="agreement" ref="title">Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.</claim>

But <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="17" rel="rebuttal" ref="11">I'm not conviced that this is always a bad thing.</claim>

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="18" rel="support" ref="17">After all the gore I witnessed on 4chan, I'm able to jump in an accident scene and actually keep my cool while most other people around are freaking out like crazed apes, yelling and really doing nothing to help at all.</premise>
<premise type="pathos" id="19" rel="support" ref="17">After all the freak sexualities i was exposed to in 4chan, I find it hard to judge anyone about anything they do with their bodies and partners.</premise>

And so on.

<claim type="interpretation" id="20" rel="rebuttal" ref="11">I'd say 4chan will open your eyes and show you Reality on many topics.</claim>

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="21" rel="support" rid="a" ref="20">It can have a bad influence with all the racism etc tho</premise> but <premise type="logos_pathos" id="22" rel="support" rid="a" ref="20">this, you have to keep in check yourself</premise>.

About "pessimism"..well yeah...<premise type="pathos" id="23" rel="support" ref="20">some people may answer to you that there is not much to be optimistic about in this world and that maybe you are delusional/uninformed to think otherwise</premise>.

I've had no follow up on this incident.
