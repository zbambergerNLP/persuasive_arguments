T1	main_claim 0 74	CMV: America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had
A1	Type1 T1 evaluation_emotional
T2	premise 76 133	There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973
A2	Type3 T2 logos
T3	premise 137 225	Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion
A3	Type3 T3 logos
T4	claim 229 387	These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up
A4	Type2 T4 evaluation_emotional
T5	claim 391 541	Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million
A5	Type2 T5 evaluation_emotional
T6	claim 545 675	One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems
A6	Type2 T6 interpretation
T7	premise 678 859	Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues
A7	Type3 T7 logos
T8	premise 863 921	America's innovation and education rankings would be lower
A8	Type3 T8 logos
T9	premise 924 1040	Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around
A9	Type3 T9 logos_pathos
T10	claim 1388 1411	Its a complicated issue
A10	Type2 T10 interpretation
T11	premise 1414 1651	Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population
A11	Type3 T11 logos
T12	premise 1654 1793	Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange
A12	Type3 T12 logos
T13	claim 1809 1866	it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive
A13	Type2 T13 evaluation_emotional
T14	premise 1869 2055	Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	claim 2162 2330	Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children
A15	Type2 T15 interpretation
T16	claim 2333 2407	Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons
A16	Type2 T16 interpretation
T17	premise 2414 2445	surely its a significant number
A17	Type3 T17 logos_pathos
T18	premise 2451 2585	how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower
A18	Type3 T18 logos_pathos
T19	claim 2588 2673	This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value
A19	Type2 T19 interpretation
T20	claim 2688 2791	Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding.
A20	Type2 T20 evaluation_rational
T21	claim 2845 2959	this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point*
A21	Type2 T21 evaluation_rational
T22	claim 2996 3144	Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems
A22	Type2 T22 interpretation
T23	claim 3150 3254	would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit
A23	Type2 T23 interpretation
T24	premise 3266 3373	An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus
A24	Type3 T24 logos_pathos
T25	claim 3380 3477	in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not
A25	Type2 T25 evaluation_emotional
T26	claim 3481 3616	Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one
A26	Type2 T26 interpretation
T27	claim 3619 3771	This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country
A27	Type2 T27 interpretation
T28	claim 3774 3828	Modern technology like the internet must be considered
A28	Type2 T28 evaluation_emotional
T29	claim 4656 4750	Do you really think abortions are only had by incompetent people who couldn't be good parents?
A29	Type2 T29 evaluation_rational
T30	claim 4751 4839	This appears to be a belief that has led you to conclude that America must be better off
A30	Type2 T30 interpretation
T31	claim 4844 4916	you are really misinformed about the type of women who obtain abortions.
A31	Type2 T31 interpretation
T32	claim 4919 4936	That may be true.
A32	Type2 T32 evaluation_rational
T33	claim 4937 5101	My thinking was that abortions were mainly required by unfortunate people, who in turn from their difficult circumstances, would've raised the child to be the same.
A33	Type2 T33 evaluation_emotional
T34	premise 5102 5123	Can you counter that?
A34	Type3 T34 logos_pathos
T35	premise 5124 5327	I have a [source](http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2010/05/04/index.html) that shows that abortions are typically (and in some years, mostly) had by people without enough wealth to care for there kids.
A35	Type3 T35 logos_pathos
T36	premise 5564 5690	Some stats for example include "31% of women obtaining abortions are in school; 68% of women who have abortions are employed."
A36	Type3 T36 logos_pathos
T37	premise 5691 5854	"33% of women who obtain abortions have family incomes under $11,000 annually, 11% of abortions are obtained by women whose household incomes are $50,000 or more."
A37	Type3 T37 ethos_logos
T38	premise 5858 5989	that means the majority of those having abortions have income between $11,000 and $55,000, which is above the Federal Poverty line.
A38	Type3 T38 logos
T39	claim 5990 6125	I can't confirm but I do recall reading once that a common reason for women to abort is becoming pregnant too soon after having a child
A39	Type2 T39 interpretation
T40	premise 6128 6214	It could be about finances but could just be too soon for a woman to go through again.
A40	Type3 T40 logos_pathos
T41	premise 6215 6307	Pregnancy is hard on the body and far riskier than an abortion performed within a few weeks.
