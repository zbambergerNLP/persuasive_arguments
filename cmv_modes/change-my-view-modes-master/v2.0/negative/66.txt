CMV: Assuming there is no afterlife, then life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die.

*Note: Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post.
I am not religious.
Thank you.
ALSO: By "meaningless," I mean "meaningless" to the person who is doing the dying.
To the person who is alive and who will then die, life is meaningless.

CMV.
Assuming there is no afterlife , life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die .
Death is the great eraser .
Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory .
It is comparable to that, too .

It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die .
Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness .
Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing .
To me, it is as if my life had never happened .

I'll put it another way.
Imagine the time before you were born .
Have you remembered it yet?
Of course not .
You didn't exist .
This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth .
When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness , and I return to it permanently . I might as well have never lived .

To anticipate a few responses:

(1) Helping others doesn't matter .
They will die too .
And then their descendants will die, on and on and on , until eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death .
Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me , assuming they all die , then my life is still pointless and meaningless .
For I will be dead and won't know what I did , and once they die, they won't know either .

(2) Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal."
I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness .
Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame .

(3) Enjoying the moment is possible , but doesn't make life have a point .
For once I die, all memories and all point is gone .

Please change my view from this depressing sentiment.


You make your own purpose in life .
The only way your life lacks meaning is if you give it none to begin with .
I would question why you feel that an action's effects have to be felt in perpetuity and never cease in order to be considered "meaningful" to oneself?


Because once you die, it is as if none of it ever happened .
None of it.

So to YOU, there is, then, no meaning .
