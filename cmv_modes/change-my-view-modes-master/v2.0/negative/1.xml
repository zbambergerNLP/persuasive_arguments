So recently I've seen a lot of posts condemning Islam as a violent religion or a sexist religion.
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0" rel="agreement" ref="title">I point out that many Christians follow the bible which has numerous examples of sexism, but in application, there are numerous branches of Christianity that are no more sexist than secular groups.</claim>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="1" rel="support" ref="0">For example, Congregationalists and Universaliists.</premise>

So, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="2" rel="agreement" ref="title">my belief is that while religion can inform the views of people, it is far more likely that religion will be used to justify actions that would have been executed any way.</claim> <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="3" rel="agreement" ref="2">I think that most Jewish people don't want to stone adulterers and most Muslims don't want to stone non believers.</claim>

<claim type="agreement" id="3da" rel="partial_agreement" ref="3a">Okay</claim>, <claim type="interpretation" id="3d" rel="undercutter" ref="3a">but even if religion did motivate people to kill, it doesn't provide the means to kill, only the motivation. </claim>

That being said, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="3f" rel="rebuttal" ref="3a"> I'm not convinced that either motivates people to kill, and one gives the tools to kill with and the other doesn't </claim>.

<claim type="interpretation" id="3h" rel="undercutter" ref="3d"> Religion gives them the psychological tools to justify to themselves that killing is ok. </claim> 
<premise type="logos" id="3i" rel="support" rid="a" ref="3h"> Without that, they wouldn't be able to kill. </premise>

Hm, that sounds more like the motivation though.
