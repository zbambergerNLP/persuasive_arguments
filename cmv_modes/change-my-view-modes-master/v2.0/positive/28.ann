A11	Type3 T11 logos
T12	premise 734 924	The newly defined chicken species (a species is hard enough to define as it is) is not recognized as a new species of chickens until you already have an independently reproducing population.
A12	Type3 T12 logos
T13	premise 932 980	there were ancestral species that produced eggs,
A13	Type3 T13 logos
T14	claim 981 1136	due to the gradual process that produces what we call new species and how we define them, there was never a single egg that gave rise to the first chicken.
