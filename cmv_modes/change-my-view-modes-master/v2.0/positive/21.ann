T1	main_claim 0 108	CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...
A1	Type1 T1 interpretation
T2	claim 110 136	The options are as follows
A2	Type2 T2 evaluation_rational
T3	claim 140 204	1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.
A3	Type2 T3 evaluation_rational
T4	claim 206 309	2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure.
A4	Type2 T4 evaluation_emotional
T5	claim 311 423	3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.
A5	Type2 T5 interpretation
T6	premise 436 562	I used to follow 'option number 3', but recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values.
A6	Type3 T6 logos_pathos
T7	claim 563 635	I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however
A7	Type2 T7 evaluation_emotional
T8	claim 671 799	I think restricting this concept to the meat industry limits us to a "vegetarian/vegan lifestyle vs. carnivore lifestyle" debate
A8	Type2 T8 interpretation
T9	claim 807 844	it's actually a lot deeper than that.
A9	Type2 T9 evaluation_rational
T10	premise 846 974	I know, for instance, that components in my smartphone and laptop are made of minerals that were mined by slave labor in Africa.
A10	Type3 T10 logos_pathos
T11	premise 975 1114	I know that the chocolates I love to eat contain, in all likelihood, cacao that was farmed by people living in truly deplorable conditions.
A11	Type3 T11 logos_pathos
T12	premise 1115 1224	I know that the medication I take was almost certainly tested on research animals who lived short, sad lives.
A12	Type3 T12 logos_pathos
T13	premise 1225 1365	I know that there's a good chance that the shirt I'm wearing was produced by underpaid, overworked labors who might have even been children.
A13	Type3 T13 logos_pathos
T14	premise 1366 1535	I know that the salad I'm planning to eat for lunch contains ingredients that were probably farmed in environmentally destructive ways that contribute to climate change.
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	premise 1536 1667	I know that my leftover Christmas cookies, made by my vegetarian mother, still contain eggs that probably came from a battery farm.
A15	Type3 T15 logos_pathos
T16	premise 1668 1800	I know that by purchasing my knockoff Keurig coffee from Wal-Mart, I'm supporting a corporation that exploits everything it touches.
A16	Type3 T16 logos_pathos
T17	claim 2058 2160	A completely ethical lifestyle is probably not possible without completely rejecting the modern world.
A17	Type2 T17 interpretation
T18	claim 2233 2313	I have to accept that I will *never* be able to fully live within my own values.
A18	Type2 T18 interpretation
T19	claim 2314 2343	I see what you're getting at.
A19	Type2 T19 agreement
T20	premise 2344 2448	It's easier to forget and ignore because there's too much injustice in the world if you tally it all up.
A20	Type3 T20 pathos
T21	claim 2449 2532	I'd still consider what you described as being the third option on my original post
A21	Type2 T21 agreement
T22	claim 2539 2596	it's a very detailed version of it that explains it well.
A22	Type2 T22 agreement
T23	premise 2752 2870	This would also be my reasoning if I were vegan but still wouldn't take a flight out to help build a school in Africa.
A23	Type3 T23 logos_pathos
T24	premise 2871 2951	It would also make sense if I was building a school in African but wasn't vegan.
A24	Type3 T24 ethos_logos
T25	claim 2952 3065	If I was doing absolutely nothing to aid any of the values I believe in, then it wouldn't make any sense however.
A25	Type2 T25 interpretation
T26	claim 3068 3072	Yeah
A26	Type2 T26 agreement
T27	claim 3075 3174	I think there's just a limited number of things that people are capable of caring about at one time
A27	Type2 T27 interpretation
T28	claim 3181 3257	issues that are of personal relevance are always going to carry more weight.
A28	Type2 T28 evaluation_rational
T29	premise 3258 3457	So while someone might take Option 1 on a personally significant issue that has a lot of meaning to them, the limitations of the human mind force them to take Option 3 on a whole lot of other issues.
A29	Type3 T29 logos
T30	claim 3458 3566	So somebody who takes Option 3 on a particular issue may not be making a true choice to *ignore* that issue.
A30	Type2 T30 evaluation_rational
T31	claim 3567 3616	They're just prioritizing their mental resources.
A31	Type2 T31 interpretation
T32	premise 3617 3694	Without prioritizing those resources, there's a risk of "compassion fatigue,"
A32	Type3 T32 logos
T33	premise 3695 3923	which you see frequently among people in empathy-intensive occupations (especially medicine, education, and other fields where issues outside the individual's control tend to produce strong feelings of frustration and futility).
A33	Type3 T33 logos_pathos
T34	premise 3925 3968	I do care about the welfare of food animals
A34	Type3 T34 pathos
T35	premise 3975 4082	I do think that there are ways to produce meat in ways that are at least more humane if not more "ethical."
A35	Type3 T35 logos_pathos
T36	premise 4083 4130	I support these efforts when they're available.
A36	Type3 T36 logos_pathos
T37	premise 4131 4390	But I also think that the welfare of food animals is part of a much larger constellation of interrelated "food production issues" that involve everything from environmental impacts to worker safety to the corporatization of agriculture to government subsidies
A37	Type3 T37 logos
T38	premise 4402 4540	without some major changes to those other "food production issues" then there probably won't be significant improvement in animal welfare.
A38	Type3 T38 logos
T39	claim 4557 4657	it's good that people have different Option 1 priorities to attack the problems from multiple sides.
A39	Type2 T39 evaluation_rational
T40	claim 4671 4707	whilst my original view still stands
A40	Type2 T40 interpretation
T41	claim 4710 4838	you've altered it in such a way that I now feel a little able to understand others better and in a less scornful light at least!
