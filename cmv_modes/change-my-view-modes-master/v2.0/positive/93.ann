T14	claim 1434 1638	The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels
A14	Type2 T14 interpretation
T15	premise 1641 1815	Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt

A24	Type3 T24 logos
T25	claim 2648 2653	Right
A25	Type2 T25 agreement
T26	claim 2664 2789	the inventor of nativity scenes think it would "look cooler" because it portrays Joseph as a stereotypical Jewish cheapskate?
A26	Type2 T26 evaluation_emotional
T27	claim 2790 2844	Why change things from the biblical version of events?
A27	Type2 T27 evaluation_rational
T28	claim 2847 2966	If the various artists who contributed to the scene had intended to make Joseph stereotypically Jewish, they would have

A30	Type3 T30 logos_pathos
T31	claim 3101 3150	But no: they don't make Joseph look Jewish at all
A31	Type2 T31 interpretation
T32	premise 3153 3251	If there's anything anti-Semitic going on, it's the near-erasure of Jesus/Mary/Joseph's Jewishness

A33	Type2 T33 interpretation

A36	Type3 T36 logos
T37	premise 3488 3567	The visit of the shepherds and the visit of the kings are narratively redundant
