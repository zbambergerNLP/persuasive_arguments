T1	main_claim 0 58	CMV: Otherkin are delusional and should be treated as such
A1	Type1 T1 evaluation_emotional
T2	premise 60 91	The DSM-IV defines delusion as:
A2	Type3 T2 logos
T3	premise 92 319	A false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary.
A3	Type3 T3 logos_pathos
T4	claim 321 427	Otherkin, or animalkin, the belief that their soul is an animal or something nonhuman, fit this definition
A4	Type2 T4 interpretation
T5	claim 432 528	should be urged to seek psychiatric evaluation rather than joining communities of similar "kin."
A5	Type2 T5 evaluation_emotional
T6	premise 530 614	If someone walks around genuinely convinced they are Jesus, the person is delusional
A6	Type3 T6 pathos
T7	premise 619 743	others would want to see that person medicated or receiving some form of psychiatric treatment for that persons own benefit.
A7	Type3 T7 pathos
T8	premise 744 910	But out of fear of offending and looking like an insensitive bigot, no one would respond to an otherkin in the same way they would someone claiming ultimate divinity.
A8	Type3 T8 logos_pathos
T9	claim 912 1031	We should not encourage and accept otherkin behavior, but rather encourage seeking treatment for a delusional disorder.
A9	Type2 T9 interpretation
T10	premise 1039 1224	Since you mentioned the DSM IV, it is worth pointing out that all of the disorders listed in the DSM IV have one central piece of criteria that is at the heart of the diagnostic process
A10	Type3 T10 logos
T11	premise 1262 1407	that has to do with the degree to which the disorder is disruptive not only to the person who has the disorder, but to the general public as well
A11	Type3 T11 logos
T12	claim 1492 1668	Generally speaking, delusions themselves are arguably less relevant to whether or not a behavior is indicative of a disorder than are the social repercussions of that behavior.
A12	Type2 T12 evaluation_rational
T13	premise 1669 1720	Take for instance being "taken by the holy spirit".
A13	Type3 T13 logos_pathos
T14	premise 1721 1900	From an outside perspective, this certainly appears to me to be a delusional behavior, but of course this alone is not enough for it to meet the criteria of a particular disorder.
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	premise 1901 2131	As people can engage in all kinds of delusional behavior and often still function in the world quite well, this is not sufficient evidence for whether or not something should or should not be constituted as evidence of a disorder.
A15	Type3 T15 logos_pathos
T16	premise 2133 2265	The belief that one has an animal spirit is not new and has been a component of many primitive animistic cultures throughout history
A16	Type3 T16 logos_pathos
T17	premise 2272 2333	certain Native American practices still have vestiges of this
A17	Type3 T17 logos_pathos
T18	premise 2343 2494	most of us wouldn't describe them as "delusional" simply because they follow the traditions of their ancestors as they've been practiced for centuries.
A18	Type3 T18 logos_pathos
T19	claim 2496 2654	While you may find the practice disingenuous or disgusting, this is not reason enough to hold the behavior as evidence of a specific disorder in and of itself
A19	Type2 T19 evaluation_rational
T20	claim 2661 2932	in cases where there may be genuine mental illness involved, I believe that there's enough criteria already set forth in the DSM to diagnose these conditions accurately without directly addressing this particular cultural phenomenon as some kind of mental health outlier.
A20	Type2 T20 evaluation_rational
T21	claim 2943 2956	You're right.
A21	Type2 T21 agreement
T22	premise 2957 3084	I forgot that one of the main diagnostic criteria for almost any mental disorder is the impact it has on the persons well-being
A22	Type3 T22 logos_pathos
T23	claim 3091 3260	if someone is generally in a better state identifying as an otherkin, then there would be no real need to treat them, unless they started disrupting the lives of others.
