CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare

Title is mostly to get attention, and I'm working from a specific set of assumptions.
My argument is as follows:

1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products

2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand

3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.

4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.

4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms , I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. **
However**:

5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing , which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.

My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers , and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.
Moreover, this practice would be much easier to "evangelize" than a vegetarian or vegan diet.
Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)


Making a political statement is not the same as organizing a boycott.
Vegans live the way they do because they feel a certain way about the way we exploit animals.
However, I strongly, strongly doubt they believe that in doing so, they are making great strides in improving conditions for animals.
I think you are misinterpreting their motives.

I don't believe in donating to the Salvation Army, for example, because there have been incidents in the past where their organization has denied aid to homosexuals and publicly expressed homophobic views.
However, I do NOT believe that my actions will bring about the demise of the Salvation Army, or really have any effect at all.
That is not my motive.
That would just be delusional.
I think the vast majority of vegans and vegetarians are not delusional and feel similarly about the meat industry as I do about the Salvation Army.


I totally agree, and that's why i tried to keep the scope of this CMV relatively limited to "improving general animal welfare".


Yes but your stated view is "veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare," as if there are real people that actually think that.


There are.
I know several of them (I understand that anecdotal evidence is not the best kind of evidence but there you have it).


Are you sure?
I mean, if you've met people like that, they're wrong, simple as that.
And they don't represent the majority of vegans, that's for sure.

But I strongly doubt there are people who actually think, "not eating meat is *definitely* the BEST THING I can do for animal welfare!"
That makes zero sense.
Even if they think that being vegan is a way to directly improve conditions for animals, I don't think they believe it's the *best* way.
Sorry but I think this is a strawman argument.


It's good to know that this view doesn't make up the majority of vegans.
The vegans who believe the way I've described and who made up a good chunk of the vegans I've encountered, were a large part of my inspiration to write this CMV.
That plus the fact that a large portion of the vegan advocacy I've seen revolves around the horrors of factory farming which, I believe, would be far more effectively reduced by responsible carnivory than by veganism.

I don't quite think that makes my argument a strawman, or incorrect, but your point is well-taken. âˆ†
