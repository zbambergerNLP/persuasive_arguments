CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance.
The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.

I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes.
It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right.
Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments.
Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries , the far-left has for the most part been dealt with .
However the far-right continues to be a menace.

I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right.
These groups are always extreme fringes , and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place .

Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.

Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty , such leaders are given a free hand .
On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers.
Wouldn't restricting "free speech" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?

Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash , but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate .
I see this as a major flaw in democracy.
Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.

Instead, I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism .
After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies .

Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough , and their will always be a few bad apples .
These bad apples need to be weeded out .
Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society.

The only constant is change.
Global stability is a myth grown out of a population that has gotten good at balancing acts.
The supports necessary for real stability simply don't exist.

To carry out a balancing act, you have to avoid any extreme reactions, as they only make for larger oscillations.
Censorship is an extreme reaction to an extreme force , and here are two very good arguments for why should be seen as an extreme option:

1) There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society. We claim that our old positions were wrong, and have good evidence to back this up.
With this in mind, we are forced to acknowledge that we are probably making errors in other places, and may even have been led astray in one of the areas we have already changed.
Censorship halts this process and locks in whatever is current.

2) Censorship does not eliminate the censored individual.
Indeed, they will work hard to evade the censor, carrying out their activities further from the public eye.
This brings their arguments out of public discourse, where a solid counter-argument is more likely to be interjected.
It also dooms any attempt to change their beliefs, as their opponents no longer understand those beliefs sufficiently to do this.
Finally it gives them a true claim that they are being oppressed and targeted, which history suggests tends to strengthen a group.


Good arguments .
Although I may disagree somewhat, I see why censorship can be dangerous.
One thing about censorship : don't you think it's a problem that the likes of ISIS some neo-nazi groups actively recruit on twitter and facebook ? Should't this sort of thing be stopped ?

&gt; There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society

While this may be true, hasn't the killing of innocents (and murder or rape, or destruction of property) always been considered deeply immoral (outside of wars) ?

We already clamp down on extremism, and potential extremists are actively monitored using existing surveillance techniques.
Is it really that bad to go after them just a little bit more ?

Anyhow, for a well thought out response:
