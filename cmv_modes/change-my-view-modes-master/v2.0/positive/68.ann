A1	Type1 T1 evaluation_rational
T2	claim 295 416	simple enough that almost anyone could, if they were struck by the impulse to make that unusually large commitment, do so
A2	Type2 T2 evaluation_emotional
T3	premise 419 476	Like, most people don't memorize all of Romeo and Juliet.
A3	Type3 T3 logos_pathos
T4	premise 477 539	But most people, I think, if they really wanted to, **could.**
A4	Type3 T4 logos_pathos
T5	premise 765 912	I'm 100% on board with trashing the US constitution and starting from scratch with new documents, so appealing to the constitution is not on topic.
A5	Type3 T5 logos_pathos
T6	premise 959 1030	I think the American legal system has gotten out of hand in complexity.
A6	Type3 T6 pathos
T7	claim 1031 1169	I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them.
A7	Type2 T7 interpretation
T8	claim 1171 1387	Ideally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category's laws.
A8	Type2 T8 evaluation_rational
T9	premise 1389 1538	By categories, I mean things like: criminal law; the tax code; any given category of regulation by profession (medical, construction, IT, and so on).
A9	Type3 T9 pathos
T10	claim 1632 1763	it should be well within the average citizen's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it.
A10	Type2 T10 evaluation_rational
T11	claim 2678 2755	I entirely agree that certain parts are unnecessarily complex and complicated
A11	Type2 T11 agreement
T12	premise 2758 2876	I don't think you'll find many people who disagree that the American legal system could be slimmed down substantially.
A12	Type3 T12 logos_pathos
T13	claim 2974 3054	a substantial degree of complexity is necessary for certain aspects to function.
A13	Type2 T13 interpretation
T14	premise 3056 3081	First, take criminal law.
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	premise 3082 3178	Let's assume that laws are created on the premise that they outlaw an action that is morally bad
A15	Type3 T15 logos_pathos
T16	premise 3255 3326	Some things are clear cut - hitting a small child would be morally bad.
A16	Type3 T16 logos_pathos
T17	premise 3381 3483	Going down this train of logic will ultimately lead to a purely utilitarian theory on the legal system
A17	Type3 T17 logos_pathos
T18	premise 3486 3557	That isn't to say that it would be better or worse than our's currently
A18	Type3 T18 logos
T19	premise 3564 3681	given the immense literature on utilitarianism I doubt any high schooler could reasonably be expected to memorize it.
A19	Type3 T19 logos
T20	premise 3683 3759	Second, let's look at regulation by profession, specifically bank regulation
A20	Type3 T20 logos
T21	premise 3815 3852	It's a 800-odd page legislative titan
A21	Type3 T21 logos
T22	claim 3916 4012	a lot of it is necessary for a functional judicial system to determine what is and is not legal.

T23	premise 4013 4053	Take the Volcker rule and prop. trading.
A23	Type3 T23 logos
T24	premise 4054 4111	That's explicitly illegal now (well, kind of... not yet).
A24	Type3 T24 logos_pathos
T25	premise 4112 4238	There isn't a huge moral justification to regulations such as these other than 'they increase risk and excessive risk is bad'.
A25	Type3 T25 logos_pathos
T26	premise 4414 4479	Some of these things just ultimately need someone saying "Enough!
A26	Type3 T26 logos_pathos
T27	premise 4480 4546	We'll agree on 5% or we will agree to disagree." and to codify it.
A27	Type3 T27 logos_pathos
T28	premise 4547 4646	However, that codification, even if is only one line applied to hundreds of laws, would be immense.
A28	Type3 T28 logos
T29	claim 4681 4935	We could create a system that simply pointed to morally impermissible actions as illegal, but that would lead to large discrepancies (or would need have some other system to define what is morally impermissible, out of scope of a high schooler's memory).
A29	Type2 T29 evaluation_rational
T30	claim 4939 5134	In order to eliminate discrepancies, the system needs to codify at least some specific instances, and by doing such for an immense number of actions we go beyond, well, *any* one person's memory.
