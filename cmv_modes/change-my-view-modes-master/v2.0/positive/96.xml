Really though.
<premise type="pathos" id="0" rel="support" ref="title">There is an unchecked organization that spies on them 24/7 without consent.</premise>
<premise type="pathos" id="1" rel="support" ref="title">The US has given itself license to detain and torture citizens with no trial.</premise>
<premise type="pathos" id="2" rel="support" ref="title">The energy laws in that country allow corporations to drill where they please and, as a result, poison who they please.</premise>
American citizens have clearly been lied to in many situations.
These lies have led to events like the second gulf war.
Not to mention the completely unregulated financial system.

Honestly, none of these things have been democratically voted for, so why are Americans so deluded about this?
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="3" rel="agreement" ref="title">It's not a free, democratic society by any means.</claim>
<claim type="interpretation" id="4" rel="agreement" ref="3">It's clearly an oligarchy</claim>

<claim type="interpretation" id="5" rel="rebuttal" ref="3">A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free.</claim>
<premise type="logos" id="6" rel="support" ref="5">The USA was intended to be a federal republic, a republic being a form of indirect democracy.</premise>
To see if it actually *is* one (at least the "republic" part), we just need to answer a few simple questions.

<claim type="interpretation" id="7" rel="rebuttal" ref="3">Is political power in the US held by elected officials?</claim>

<claim type="interpretation" id="8" rel="rebuttal" ref="3">Are those officials elected in free and fair democratic elections?</claim>

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="9" rel="agreement" ref="7_8">The answer to both of those questions is unambiguously "yes."</claim> 
<premise type="logos" id="10" rel="support" ref="9">The domestic spying, the secret courts, the torture, the corporate favoritism, the environmental destruction, the lies, the unjustified wars, the unregulated financial system... all of those are things instituted or approved by our democratically elected officials, fully within the scope of power ceded to them by the constitution.</premise>
And <premise type="pathos" id="11" rel="support" ref="9">we continue to vote those who do these things into office in free and fair elections, time and time again, without fail</premise>.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="12" rel="partial_agreement" ref="3">You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state</claim>, but <claim type="interpretation" id="13" rel="rebuttal" ref="3">it remains by definition a democratic one</claim>.

Edit: but how can you have truly fair elections if things like superpacs exist?

What's your basis for believing that SuperPACs make elections un-free or un-fair?

&gt; Okay, I think you have officially Changed My View haha

Glad this has been a productive discussion.
If your view has indeed been changed, please draw your attention to "The delta (&#8710;) system" in the sidebar and award me one delta.

<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="37" rel="agreement" ref="title">The reason I think this is important is because I'm pissed off about the way things are in America</claim>, as I'm sure you are, and <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="38" rel="agreement" ref="title">I always think that the best way to address a problem is to see it for what it is</claim>.
<claim type="interpretation" id="39" rel="rebuttal" ref="title">America's problem isn't that it isn't a democracy</claim>; rather, <claim type="interpretation" id="40" rel="undercutter" ref="title">I think that America's problem is that it has fetishized democracy to the point where anything resulting from that system is accepted, even if it's corrupt and tyrannical</claim>, and <claim type="interpretation" id="41" rel="agreement" ref="40">that's exactly what it's turning into</claim>.
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="42" rel="support" ref="41">No, we're probably never going to get money out of politics entirely</premise>, but <premise type="logos_pathos" id="43" rel="support" ref="41">corporations being able to anonymously fund entire campaigns is a major threat to healthy government, even if it isn't, strictly speaking, un-democratic</premise>.

A delta for you then! (I'm new, so sorry in advance if I mess it up)

Maybe I put forward the wrong view, but <claim type="agreement" id="44" rel="agreement" ref="40">I think you and I more or less agree that their is something fetid in the system</claim>.
<premise type="pathos" id="45" rel="support" ref="44">I get tired of seeing people worship at the altar of the US flag</premise> - <premise type="pathos" id="46" rel="support" ref="44">they seem blind to what the US government is really about</premise>.
