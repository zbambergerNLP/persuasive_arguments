CMV: Nativity scenes are antisemitic.

This has nothing to do with the celebration of Christmas excluding religious minorities , it's because traditional nativity scenes reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews .

As the story goes, when Jesus was about to be born his parents were travelling to Bethlehem, but when they got there the inn was full, so Mary had to give birth in the barn .
The problem is, if nativity scenes are any indication, baby Jesus was still in the manger when the three wise men came to visit and give him Christmas presents .
Most people know Jesus was born on Christmas, but less realize that the wise men didn't show up until the Epiphany twelve days later .

Are we honestly expected to believe that no vacancies opened up at the inn for almost two weeks? Because that would be the most unbelievable aspect of the entire story if you ask me , and it seriously strains credulity to begin with .

Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God .
Maybe a virgin really could give birth to a deity, or a new star could magically appear over the birthplace , but there's no reason for the inn to miraculously have no rooms come open for nearly two weeks .
Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving .

The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels .
Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt .
After all, why did they stay so long anyway?
It's not like Mary needed the time to recuperate .
Thanks to baby Jesus' healing powers even her hymen immediately regenerated, kind of like the redhead vampire from True Blood or the cheerleader from Heroes .
( Not the real life Hayden Panettiere though, you know those gigantic Klitschkos split that wide open. )

MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Traditionally, in medieval Christian art, there is no consideration of time .
In other words, events that happen at different points in the narrative are depicted as occuring side-by-side without consideration for *when* and *where* they actually happened .
For instance, Jesus might be depicted as both a child and an adult in the same image .

One of the reasons the Italian Renaissance was, well, a *renaissance* was because its painters and artists began presenting things in a more realistic way , like how we might now think of as like a photograph: a specific moment frozen in time .

My point is, there is precedent for depicting stories from the Jesus narrative with no consideration for the actual timeline of events , merely throwing together elements because they are related thematically or tangentially .
You're interpretting this as if it is meant to show something "as it happened" when art doesn't always work that way .


&#8710; Thanks for the input, I'll give you a delta but this seems to me more or less the same argument from artistic license .
