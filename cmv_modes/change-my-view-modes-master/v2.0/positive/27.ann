T12	claim 1151 1241	My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers
A12	Type2 T12 evaluation_emotional

T16	premise 1587 1656	Making a political statement is not the same as organizing a boycott.
A16	Type3 T16 logos
T17	premise 1657 1750	Vegans live the way they do because they feel a certain way about the way we exploit animals.

A18	Type2 T18 evaluation_emotional
T19	premise 1885 1931	I think you are misinterpreting their motives.
A19	Type3 T19 logos
T20	premise 1933 2138	I don't believe in donating to the Salvation Army, for example, because there have been incidents in the past where their organization has denied aid to homosexuals and publicly expressed homophobic views.

T22	premise 2266 2288	That is not my motive.
A22	Type3 T22 logos
T23	claim 2320 2467	I think the vast majority of vegans and vegetarians are not delusional and feel similarly about the meat industry as I do about the Salvation Army.
A23	Type2 T23 evaluation_emotional
T24	claim 2470 2486	I totally agree,
A24	Type2 T24 agreement
T25	claim 2766 2776	There are.
A25	Type2 T25 disagreement
T26	premise 2777 2894	I know several of them (I understand that anecdotal evidence is not the best kind of evidence but there you have it).

T27	claim 2919 2981	if you've met people like that, they're wrong, simple as that.
A27	Type2 T27 evaluation_emotional
T28	claim 3049 3184	But I strongly doubt there are people who actually think, "not eating meat is *definitely* the BEST THING I can do for animal welfare!"

A29	Type3 T29 logos_pathos
