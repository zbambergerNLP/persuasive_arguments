<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0">Maybe it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex</claim>, but <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="1">I'm beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.</claim>

<premise type="pathos" id="2" rel="support" ref="3">"Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?"</premise> I wonder (<claim type="interpretation" id="3">my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss's *The Game*</claim>).
"<premise type="logos_pathos" id="4" rel="support" ref="1">Why do I feel like chasing after girls and getting to know them when I have so many great guy friends already who I know care about me so much more?</premise> <premise type="logos_pathos" id="5" rel="support" ref="1">Why can't I be friends with girls (even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I don't try to advance some romantic agenda?</premise>
<premise type="pathos" id="6" rel="support" ref="1">Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them?</premise>"

I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships, but instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read, I ask just the one title question (thinking that <claim type="interpretation" id="9">the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding</claim>) <premise type="logos" id="10" rel="support" ref="9">because I want to know what older, more mature people think</premise>.
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="11">It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy's school for the majority of my life.</claim>

At times, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="12">I feel like the interplay between men and women is always (at least always initially) a bs game</claim> where <premise type="logos_pathos" id="13" rel="support" ref="12">the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="14" rel="support" ref="15">Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me</premise> that <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="15">I can't stand it</claim>.
Please change this view.

Id just like to point out that <claim type="disagreement" id="16" rel="rebuttal_attack" ref="1">this has never remotely seemed the case from my perspective as a lesbian</claim>.
Beyond that, <claim type="disagreement" id="17" rel="rebuttal_attack" ref="1">there are many people who want close relationships without romance</claim>, <premise type="logos" id="18" rel="support" ref="17">an obvious example would be asexual people</premise>.
<premise type="logos" id="19" rel="support" ref="17">They can have close relationships that rival that of marriage</premise>, but <premise type="logos" id="20" rel="support" ref="17">how would you even quantify that</premise>?
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="21" rel="support" ref="17">How can you even compare them?</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="22" rel="support" ref="17">What about the relationship of a brother and sister?</premise>

If you <premise type="pathos" id="23" rel="support" ref="24">limit it to just heterosexual non-related men and women</premise>, then <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="24" rel="partial_agreement" ref="1">maybe you're right</claim>, but then again <premise type="pathos" id="25" rel="partial_attack" ref="1">who is to say what form of relationship is the highest, two very close lifetime friends who are platonic or a married couple?</premise>

The bottom line is that <claim type="interpretation" id="26" rel="undercutter" ref="1">people are different from you</claim> can <claim type="interpretation" id="27" rel="undercutter" ref="1">relationships are hard to compare</claim>.
<premise type="logos" id="28" rel="support" ref="26">Maybe for you, every relationship with a woman is motivated by romance.</premise>
<premise type="logos_pathos" id="29" rel="support" ref="26">For someone other hetero guy it might not be.</premise>
<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="30" rel="undercutter" ref="12">Sexual attraction is not something that just shuts off</claim> so even if <premise type="logos_pathos" id="31" rel="support" ref="30">you're in a lifelong comitted closed relationship</premise> <premise type="logos_pathos" id="32" rel="support" ref="30">you'll still probably feel attraction for other people</premise>.
<claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="33" rel="undercutter" ref="12">Thats just reality for most people</claim>, and <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="34" rel="undercutter" ref="12">its not necesarily harmful and its not really shallow.</claim>

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="35" rel="undercutter" ref="1">There are very few absolutes when it comes to interpersonal relationships.</claim>

In short, <premise type="ethos_logos" id="36" rel="support" ref="37">I don't need to feel guilty when I'm attracted to people I know I can't have?</premise>
Maybe <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="37" rel="partial_agreement" ref="35">I'm too black-and-white to think that the murmurs of my id are natural and not evil</claim>.

As for which relationship is *higher* from a quantifiable standpoint, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="38" rel="agreement" ref="21">I see what you mean</claim>.
<premise type="logos" id="39" rel="support" ref="41">When I said highest, I meant it not from a perspective of quantity of some sort</premise>, but of <premise type="logos" id="40" rel="support" ref="41">a level of worth</premise>.
Looking at that statement, however, <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="41" rel="agreement" ref="21">I think you're right</claim> again--<premise type="logos_pathos" id="42" rel="support" ref="41">who is to put a romantic relationship above a friendship?</premise>

<premise type="logos_pathos" id="43" rel="support" ref="41">It's a bit extreme and morbid</premise>, but <premise type="logos_pathos" id="44" rel="support" ref="41">if I were to put someone's spouse and someone's absolute best friend in front of a train and gave that person one to save, whom would they save?</premise>
Maybe I just find that <premise type="logos_pathos" id="45" rel="support" ref="41">once I reach a certain threshold with a guy-friend, I find that we become best friends</premise>, but <premise type="logos_pathos" id="46" rel="support" ref="41">when I reach that threshold with a girl-friend, I find that I want more</premise>.
Maybe <premise type="logos_pathos" id="47" rel="support" ref="41">I haven't been around the block enough or had enough female friends to feel this way</premise>.
<premise type="ethos_logos" id="48" rel="support" ref="49">I don't have any lesbian friends (as far as I know at least)</premise>, so <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="49" rel="partial_agreement" ref="16">I don't know how I would react to being great friends with one.</claim>
