T1	main_claim 0 85	CMV: The global dominance of the abrahamic faiths is largely an accident of geography
A1	Type1 T1 interpretation
T2	premise 133 159	I'm Unitarian Universalist
A2	Type3 T2 ethos
T3	premise 313 613	Had a group of religions identical in all respects to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam developed in pretty much any area other than the middle east, they would be no more successful than any of the other relatively minor faiths out there today, depending on what the location in question actually was
A3	Type3 T3 logos
T4	premise 618 722	Whatever other religion had ended up developing in the middle east would likely now be globally dominant
A4	Type3 T4 logos
T5	claim 758 942	it seems that the core of the success of the Abrahamic religions is dependent largely on the middle east's nature as both a major trade hub between Africa, Europe, and the rest of Asia
A5	Type2 T5 interpretation
T6	claim 945 1023	and on the fertile crescent's comparatively ancient status as a settled region
A6	Type2 T6 interpretation
T7	premise 1054 1203	a large part of this view came from something a history teacher told me 6 years ago: "Geography Determines Destiny", and that quote has stuck with me
A7	Type3 T7 ethos
T8	premise 1330 1383	Christianity was primarily spread by the Roman empire
A8	Type3 T8 logos
T9	premise 1386 1454	But Rome already had a state religion before it adopted Christianity
A9	Type3 T9 logos
T10	claim 1457 1562	So the victory of Christianity over the Roman version of Hellenism can't be attributed to geography alone
A10	Type2 T10 interpretation
T11	premise 1566 1632	Likewise, Islam was hardly the first religion that Arabia had seen
A11	Type3 T11 logos
T12	claim 1635 1677	Its dominance there was not mere geography
A12	Type2 T12 interpretation
T13	claim 1682 1755	I'm definitely intrigued by this, but not quite convinced enough to delta
A13	Type2 T13 evaluation_rational
T14	claim 1758 1889	I might be able to go to "The religion eventually adopted by the Roman empire had a very good chance of becoming globally dominant"
A14	Type2 T14 evaluation_rational
T15	claim 1896 1949	I think that's still largely an accident of geography
A15	Type2 T15 interpretation
T16	claim 1956 2067	your post definitely didn't address my point A) about a hypothetical identical religion in a different location
A16	Type2 T16 evaluation_rational
T17	claim 2206 2246	Geography certainly has to be part of it
A17	Type2 T17 interpretation
T18	premise 2249 2356	If Islam had arisen amongst the Moriori instead of in Arabia, I suspect we'd have a largely Christian world
A18	Type3 T18 logos
T19	premise 2359 2465	I can't imagine missionaries travelling out of New Zealand having the same impact that the Arab armies did
A19	Type3 T19 logos_pathos
T20	claim 2473 2544	you can't blame geography for which religion became pre-eminent in Rome
A20	Type2 T20 interpretation
T21	claim 2605 2648	The emphasis on belief rather than practice
A21	Type2 T21 interpretation
T22	premise 2651 2693	For most religions, it matters what you do
A22	Type3 T22 logos
T23	premise 2696 2824	When pagan Vikings met Christians, they knew the Christian warriors would end up in Valhalla or somewhere Christianly equivalent
A23	Type3 T23 logos
T24	premise 2827 2902	Why would Thor reject a valiant warrior just because he didn't worship him?
A24	Type3 T24 logos_pathos
T25	premise 3059 3173	It seems like a compromise but the eventual outcome is that the belief wins and the practices may or may not stick
A25	Type3 T25 logos
T26	premise 3176 3315	You might be a Christian that acts like a Roman, but the word is Christian and the idols eventually disappear while the Bible sticks around
A26	Type3 T26 logos
T27	premise 3318 3393	Note that this is to a large extent what happened with the Native Americans
A27	Type3 T27 logos
T28	premise 3396 3493	It's not just that the Christians defeated the tribes militarily (though that happened sometimes)
A28	Type3 T28 logos
T29	premise 3496 3654	It's more that the Christians would come to the tribes, adopt their ways, offer them good things like education, and all they'd want is a little Bible reading
A29	Type3 T29 logos
T30	premise 3657 3800	Well the native faiths don't think reading the Bible is against their religion - they didn't emphasize belief the way Christians and Muslims do
A30	Type3 T30 logos
T31	claim 3829 3838	Education
A31	Type2 T31 interpretation
T32	premise 3841 3924	To a large extent, Judaism/Christianity/Islam were religions that demanded literacy
A32	Type3 T32 logos
T33	premise 3927 3979	This meant the teachers were also religious teachers
A33	Type3 T33 logos
T34	premise 3982 4043	Compare this to China, where literacy wasn't tied to religion
A34	Type3 T34 logos
T35	premise 4046 4185	There may have been better literacy in China, but the smartest people (or most avid readers anyway) weren't necessarily going into religion
A35	Type3 T35 logos
T36	claim 4192 4270	A whole lot of history is actually just individuals doing idiosyncratic things
A36	Type2 T36 interpretation
T37	claim 4273 4326	The right person in the right place at the right time
A37	Type2 T37 interpretation
T38	claim 4333 4345	Universalism
A38	Type2 T38 interpretation
T39	premise 4348 4458	Christianity was one of a very small number of religions that claim a duty to proselytize and convert everyone
A39	Type3 T39 logos
T40	premise 4461 4670	Most religions, confronted with a different religion, just say "this is true here and that's true there" or "those are some deities we hadn't known about" or at worst "those are some deities that are not ours"
A40	Type3 T40 logos
T41	premise 4677 4790	Christianity really goes for the "this is true for everyone for always, and we should actively work to spread it"
A41	Type3 T41 logos
T42	premise 4793 4905	If Alexander the Great had that kind of religious zealotry, he could have spread Hellenism much more than he did
A42	Type3 T42 logos_pathos
T43	premise 4912 4996	he was satisfied with just adding himself to whatever pantheon the locals worshipped
A43	Type3 T43 logos_pathos
T44	claim 5001 5114	Well, you have successfully moved me from "it's probably about 80% geography" to "it's probably 40-60% geography"
A44	Type2 T44 evaluation_rational
T45	claim 5117 5161	I think that's enough for a âˆ†, so have one
