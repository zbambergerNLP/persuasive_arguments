T1	main_claim 0 86	CMV: Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering
A1	Type1 T1 interpretation
T2	claim 130 195	I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like.
A2	Type2 T2 evaluation_rational
T3	premise 196 303	I don't care if people post nudes, I'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes.
A3	Type3 T3 logos
T4	claim 304 382	Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.
A4	Type2 T4 evaluation_emotional
T5	claim 383 540	Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.
A5	Type2 T5 evaluation_rational
T6	claim 542 681	Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.
A6	Type2 T6 interpretation
T7	claim 682 849	Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life
A7	Type2 T7 interpretation
T8	premise 855 936	simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.
A8	Type3 T8 logos_pathos
T9	premise 1319 1538	I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.
A9	Type3 T9 logos_pathos
T10	premise 2253 2278	It depends on the person.
A10	Type3 T10 logos
T11	premise 2279 2345	One person can be incredibly confident with his/her private parts.
A11	Type3 T11 logos
T12	premise 2346 2412	Therefore, the person is eager to show off and get some attention.
A12	Type3 T12 logos_pathos
T13	premise 2413 2496	However, most people are not quite as endowed or gifted as these attention-seekers.
A13	Type3 T13 logos_pathos
T14	premise 2497 2615	It's an empowering feeling to be so comfortable with yourself (endowed or not) that you are proud to post nude photos.
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	premise 2616 2651	The compliments feel great as well!
A15	Type3 T15 logos
T16	claim 2652 2696	In this sense, it is not done for attention.
A16	Type2 T16 interpretation
T17	premise 2697 2790	After all, most people choose to remain anonymous -so what attention are they really getting?
A17	Type3 T17 ethos_logos_pathos
T18	premise 2792 2892	You're also forgetting the tremendous amount of sexual energy that factors into posting nude photos.
A18	Type3 T18 logos
T19	premise 2893 2983	People enjoy browsing other's nude photos, so they decide to contribute some of their own.
A19	Type3 T19 logos_pathos
T20	premise 2984 3074	It gives them pleasure to know that other people get pleasure by seeing the posted photos.
A20	Type3 T20 logos
T21	premise 3075 3129	Again, this is more empowering than attention-seeking.
A21	Type3 T21 ethos_logos
T22	claim 3132 3169	I agree that people enjoy showing off
A22	Type2 T22 agreement
T23	premise 3192 3237	isn't that stool a form of attention seeking?
A23	Type3 T23 logos
T24	premise 3238 3436	Being proud of something (which in the case of nudes, like breast size, is sometimes uncontrollable and not something that one has to work for to attain that pride) is different than showing it off.
A24	Type3 T24 logos
T25	premise 3437 3558	I'm proud of my own genitals but I have no need to show them to anyone other than my girlfriend who I want to enjoy them.
A25	Type3 T25 logos_pathos
T26	premise 3559 3644	The difference I see is between pride and attention seeking behavior caused by pride.
A26	Type3 T26 logos
T27	claim 3646 3695	You so make a good point about the sexual energy.
A27	Type2 T27 agreement
T28	premise 3747 3919	Of course, for those in relationships or some kind of monogamous partnership, I understand the sexual energy between sharing and receiving sexual images between each other.
A28	Type3 T28 logos
T29	premise 3920 4136	In the example of the monogamous partnership, I do not consider that type of behavior as being attention seeking or anything because it is meant to be between the two individuals for their own mutual sexual pleasure.
A29	Type3 T29 pathos
T30	claim 4137 4351	The difference between that scenario (which I think most people can agree with) and posting nudes online is that often someone will post an image and an unknown amount of people may see it and get pleasure from it.
A30	Type2 T30 evaluation_rational
T31	premise 4352 4417	Nudes end up all over the internet and going into that situation,
A31	Type3 T31 logos_pathos
T32	premise 4457 4591	In anticipating this inevitability, aren't they then giving away they're nudes essentially for anyone to recurve sexual pleasure from?
A32	Type3 T32 logos_pathos
T33	claim 4592 4632	I see that behavior as attention seeking
A33	Type2 T33 evaluation_emotional
T34	premise 4641 4759	what they get in return is the gratification of strangers admitting their nudity without the mutual respect in return.
A34	Type3 T34 ethos_logos
T35	premise 4798 4971	I don't see it as one wanting to gain some type of status from it attached to themselves, but instead the gratification of having others pleasure themselves to their nudity.
A35	Type3 T35 logos_pathos
T36	premise 4972 5101	For example, internet trolls work on the basis of causing as much fuss and attention as possible while often remaining anonymous.
A36	Type3 T36 logos
T37	premise 5102 5246	They are not trying to get attention toward themselves superficially, but they're instead attention seeking to just get the attention of others.
A37	Type3 T37 logos_pathos
T38	premise 5415 5457	Do you do this to seek attention from her?
A38	Type3 T38 logos_pathos
T39	premise 5458 5499	Or do you do it because it is empowering?
A39	Type3 T39 ethos_logos_pathos
T40	premise 5500 5613	It makes you feel good when she tells you how impressed she is with your junk and when she gets pleasure from it.
A40	Type3 T40 logos
T41	premise 5614 5694	Other people don't have partners to do this with so they resort to the internet.
A41	Type3 T41 logos
T42	premise 5695 5742	Some people even have partners and still do it.
A42	Type3 T42 ethos_logos
T43	premise 5743 5803	It's a thrill and a risk that gives people immense pleasure.
A43	Type3 T43 ethos_logos_pathos
T44	premise 5946 6025	They are not getting any attention though, since they usually remain anonymous.
A44	Type3 T44 logos
T45	premise 6026 6125	Also, when it is spread online you hardly ever find out who has seen it or what people think of it.
A45	Type3 T45 logos
T46	premise 6126 6194	Therefore, you may never be able to recognize the attention you get.
A46	Type3 T46 logos_pathos
T47	premise 6195 6300	Just the act of posting the photo is enough to drive some people wild, whether 1 person sees it or 1,000.
A47	Type3 T47 logos_pathos
T48	claim 6303 6535	I want to show them to my girlfriend because I know that it makes her think of our sexual activities and I'm trying to make her think about that to remind her off how it feels good physically and to be close with her in a sexual way
A48	Type2 T48 evaluation_emotional
T49	claim 6538 6613	I don't do it to bring attention to myself, but rather to our relationship.
A49	Type2 T49 interpretation
T50	claim 6614 6701	This is much different from posting a photo that a tension stranger will masturbate to.
A50	Type2 T50 evaluation_rational
T51	premise 6703 6833	Like I've said, isn't the garnering of any attention on the internet from your nudes photos still seeking the attention of others?
A51	Type3 T51 logos
T52	premise 6834 6917	It doesn't matter how many strangers see it, just the fact that they are strangers.
A52	Type3 T52 logos_pathos
T53	premise 6918 7165	I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they're purposely looking for attention they can't find within their immediate relationships.
A53	Type3 T53 logos_pathos
T54	claim 7168 7268	You do it because you get pleasure from your girlfriend being into you and your sexual relationship.
A54	Type2 T54 agreement
T55	claim 7269 7311	This is empowering, not attention seeking.
A55	Type2 T55 disagreement
T56	claim 7312 7391	Other people do it because they get pleasure from strangers masturbating to it.
A56	Type2 T56 evaluation_rational
T57	claim 7392 7434	This is empowering, not attention seeking.
A57	Type2 T57 evaluation_emotional
T58	premise 7435 7524	Just because you don't find it empowering to post nudes, doesn't mean other people won't.
A58	Type3 T58 logos_pathos
T59	premise 7525 7617	It's impossible to assert that everyone who has posted nudes does it strictly for attention.
A59	Type3 T59 logos_pathos
T60	claim 7785 7987	I can guarantee you I was not trying to get attention from these girls, and nor was I trying to make them think of our sexual activities or remind them of sex (impossible since I didn't live near them).
A60	Type2 T60 interpretation
T61	claim 7988 8086	I enjoyed their compliments, knowing that they received pleasure, and seeing their photos as well.
A61	Type2 T61 interpretation
T62	claim 8087 8163	Sexting is an entirely separate entity that has it's own set of motivations.
A62	Type2 T62 disagreement
T63	claim 8280 8388	I just don't understand that you're of behavior and since I have never partaken in it I just can't grasp it.
A63	Type2 T63 evaluation_rational
T64	claim 8389 8491	The trouble I have is that I don't get a good enough perspective from those that do post nudes online.
A64	Type2 T64 evaluation_rational
T65	claim 8492 8528	You're right about the sexting thing
A65	Type2 T65 agreement
T66	claim 8581 8646	the fine line ice drawn is hard to find and relatively ambiguous.
A66	Type2 T66 evaluation_rational
T67	premise 8647 8714	Of course, I have no issue with sexting, considering I do it often,
A67	Type3 T67 logos
T68	claim 8715 8813	so I guess in that sense I can sort of understand the stance one would receive from posting nudes.
A68	Type2 T68 interpretation
T69	premise 8816 8944	Just as I don't necessarily understand the joy of exhibitionism, exhibitionists don't understand how I *don't* find joy from it.
A69	Type3 T69 ethos_pathos
T70	premise 8945 9050	Since I am so unaccustomed to it and do not partake in it, I can't make an uninformed judgement about it.
A70	Type3 T70 logos_pathos
T71	premise 9051 9228	I am not going to tell that person that he/she is doing it for attention - because frankly - I have no clue why exactly the person does it (the person may not even know either)!
A71	Type3 T71 pathos
T72	claim 9231 9248	Thats very true .
A72	Type2 T72 agreement
T73	claim 9458 9588	Applying it to my own life and what I personally do is a good way to assess not only this situation, but any situation in general.
