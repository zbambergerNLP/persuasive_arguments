A9	Type3 T9 pathos
T10	premise 887 1030	The main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.
A10	Type3 T10 logos_pathos
T11	claim 1031 1206	Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.
A11	Type2 T11 evaluation_emotional
T12	claim 1207 1381	The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.
A12	Type2 T12 evaluation_rational

A16	Type2 T16 interpretation
T17	claim 1943 2017	This is much more important than it's faithfulness to the source material.
A17	Type2 T17 evaluation_emotional
T18	claim 2018 2076	I believe this is true for all adaptations, not just LOTR.
A18	Type2 T18 evaluation_emotional
T19	claim 2130 2213	I want to point out that I absolutely **could not** stand to read the LotR trilogy.

T21	premise 2227 2270	I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow
A21	Type3 T21 pathos
T22	premise 2277 2400	I found Tolkien's prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot.
A22	Type3 T22 pathos
T23	claim 2402 2430	I loved the extended edition
A23	Type2 T23 evaluation_emotional

T26	premise 2735 2879	I'm the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games
A26	Type3 T26 ethos_pathos
T27	premise 2890 2985	these are things I *want to know* but typically aren't in the film/game, so I endure the chore.
A27	Type3 T27 pathos
T28	claim 2986 3068	I *love* that the extended edition helped with this, especially in this situation,
A28	Type2 T28 evaluation_emotional
T29	premise 3077 3242	most of the answers to that on the internet before were "If you want to know more you should just read the damn books, scrub!" because nerds are like that sometimes.

T30	claim 3476 3543	As a book reader, I'll still be sticking to theatrical cuts though.
