T1	main_claim 0 69	CMV: The Call of Duty franchise is extremely overrated and overhyped.
A1	Type1 T1 evaluation_emotional
T2	claim 71 156	I'd like to start off by saying that the CoD games are good games in their own right,
A2	Type2 T2 evaluation_rational
T3	claim 164 192	they are extremely overhyped
A3	Type2 T3 evaluation_rational
T4	premise 195 305	One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors.
A4	Type3 T4 logos_pathos
T5	premise 306 411	There are few if any changes in gameplay, and the basic level design for the most part, remains the same.
A5	Type3 T5 logos_pathos
T6	premise 412 547	Even Advanced Warfare, which seemed to promise the most novel changes, was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.
A6	Type3 T6 logos_pathos
T7	premise 549 678	Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesn't really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.
A7	Type3 T7 logos_pathos
T8	premise 679 835	There are a few unique features here and there, but overall, it's just another FPS with nothing spectacular that sets it above the other games in its genre.
A8	Type3 T8 logos
T9	claim 885 903	numbers don't lie.
A9	Type2 T9 interpretation
T10	premise 904 991	With absolutely anything, there will always be things that people that aren't a fan of.
A10	Type3 T10 logos_pathos
T11	premise 992 1121	Make major changes and instead of Person A hating the series and Person B loving it, now Person A loves it and Person B hates it.
A11	Type3 T11 logos
T12	premise 1363 1406	Consider the goal the creators of CoD have.
A12	Type3 T12 logos
T13	premise 1407 1421	To make money.
A13	Type3 T13 logos_pathos
T14	premise 1422 1483	And they consistently perform this goal well year after year.
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	premise 1484 1532	Now, you're an executive of Activision-Blizzard.
A15	Type3 T15 logos_pathos
T16	premise 1533 1624	Why would you tell the developers to do a complete 180 on the series, "for change's sake."?
A16	Type3 T16 logos
T17	premise 1625 1666	You only run risk and very little reward.
A17	Type3 T17 logos_pathos
T18	premise 1667 1970	If you stick to the tried and true model they've had, you're very nearly guaranteed to make a certain amount of sales. I'm sure they can graph the sales of each subsequent game and make predictions to the gradual decline with each passing year as more and more individuals grow bored of the CoD formula.
A18	Type3 T18 logos_pathos
T19	claim 1972 2127	Really, your view of "overrated and overhyped" is nothing more than an idiosyncratic reflection of your own *personal* threshold for formulaic video games.
A19	Type2 T19 evaluation_rational
T20	claim 2128 2195	But this view is separate from the objective success of the series.
A20	Type2 T20 evaluation_rational
T21	premise 2196 2278	If they keep selling games, it means people still enjoy the series for what it is.
A21	Type3 T21 pathos
T22	premise 2335 2494	There are more people who still like the series and will buy new iterations without much change compared to the minority who do find it cliche, hackneyed, etc.
A22	Type3 T22 logos_pathos
T23	premise 2495 2594	I mean, be realistic here, if they promised the most radically new CoD next year, would you buy it?
A23	Type3 T23 logos_pathos
T24	premise 2595 2608	Probably not.
A24	Type3 T24 logos_pathos
T25	premise 2609 2644	You have a bias against the series.
A25	Type3 T25 logos_pathos
T26	premise 2645 2712	Why would their target audience be the people who *don't* like CoD?
A26	Type3 T26 logos_pathos
T27	premise 2713 2731	It makes no sense.
A27	Type3 T27 logos
T28	claim 2733 2809	The other major point is that video game development is extremely expensive.
A28	Type2 T28 interpretation
T29	premise 2810 2940	Making an entirely new engine is costly, takes years to develop, and you never have a guarantee of financial success upon release.
A29	Type3 T29 logos_pathos
T30	premise 2941 3088	It makes more sense to stick with the old engine and old code, which drastically reduces the time (and therefore cost) it takes to make a new game.
A30	Type3 T30 logos
T31	claim 3089 3188	Brand new engine CoDs likely wouldn't make sufficiently more money to offset their cost to make it.
A31	Type2 T31 evaluation_rational
T32	premise 3189 3244	They aren't a charity, so gamers aren't entitled to it.
A32	Type3 T32 logos
T33	claim 3279 3371	And your explanation on why the series' games are extremely similar to each other is superb.
A33	Type2 T33 evaluation_rational
T34	claim 3372 3438	However, this in itself isn't why I think the games are overrated.
A34	Type2 T34 evaluation_rational
T35	premise 3439 3583	Many other game serie use a formulaic system for their games that renders them very similar to each other, such as Assassin's Creed, or Pokemon.
A35	Type3 T35 ethos_logos_pathos
T36	premise 3584 3712	The thing about CoD that really makes it an overrated series is that it is very similar to other FPS games, such as Battlefield.
A36	Type3 T36 logos
T37	claim 3713 3789	It really doesn't have any revolutionary groundbreaking features of its own,
A37	Type2 T37 evaluation_emotional
T38	claim 3794 3845	each game feeds off the success of its predecessor.
A38	Type2 T38 evaluation_emotional
T39	premise 3923 4045	It was the first FPS to really popularize the RPG elements of progression and grow multiplayer FPS to the size that it is.
A39	Type3 T39 logos
T40	premise 4046 4225	Halo may have been the first of its kind at the time, but CoD created a very effective system where you leveled up, unlocked new guns, and gave you customization in your load out.
A40	Type3 T40 logos_pathos
T41	premise 4226 4321	When considering the first few CoDs, this was massive and largely is attributed to its success.
A41	Type3 T41 pathos
T42	premise 4322 4395	It turned multiplayer FPS from a niche genre to if not the largest genre.
A42	Type3 T42 pathos
T43	claim 4396 4518	One can argue some earlier games like Counterstrike did something similar much sooner, for some reason CoD popularized it.
A43	Type2 T43 evaluation_emotional
T44	claim 4519 4548	Brought it to the mainstream.
A44	Type2 T44 evaluation_emotional
T45	claim 4550 4641	It's not so much that CoD is similar to other FPS as other FPSs largely copied their model.
A45	Type2 T45 evaluation_emotional
T46	premise 4642 4777	Hell, consider Halo 4 that changed their fundamental mechanics to match more of a CoD pace and include load outs and level progression.
A46	Type3 T46 pathos
T47	premise 4778 4963	It's a large statement that such a dedicated fanbase Halo had moved toward the direction of CoD. Given CoD's immense popularity, everyone wanted to jump on the bandwagon of its success.
A47	Type3 T47 logos
T48	premise 4965 5123	To view CoD as overrated for being the series that really grew the genre to what it is today would be to say WoW is overrated given how many MMOs are similar.
A48	Type3 T48 logos
T49	premise 5124 5328	When you consider there were a select few MMOs before WoW that failed to mainstream and popularize the genre, and the immense number of WoW clones after its success, it's not fair to say WoW is overrated.
A49	Type3 T49 logos_pathos
T50	premise 5329 5354	It's iconic in its genre.
A50	Type3 T50 logos_pathos
T51	claim 5355 5440	It's the copies and general state of the genre today that is overrated and hackneyed.
A51	Type2 T51 agreement
T52	claim 5457 5575	I feel that your view isn't so much feeling that CoD is overrated as it is that you feel multiplayer FPS is overrated.
