CMV: Swimming is the best form of exercise

While obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being , if someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique , there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming .
Swimming is:

A) cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels

B) resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added

C) low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems

D) whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)

With all that said and considered, is there any reason to choose another **single** form of exercise over swimming, other than lack of accessible facilities (EDIT: or physical inability to swim)?

Edit 2: view changed, because "best form of exercise" is actually meaningless .


Exercise regimens depend entirely on your goals.
Do you want to improve your cardiovascular health?
Cardio .
Do you want to work on aesthetics?
Weights .
Do you want to increase your physical strength?
Weights .
Best in terms of time investment?
Weights .
Best in terms of monetary investment?
Walking .
People have different goals , some thing running a marathon is the pinnacle of fitness , others think 5 plate deads are a better example of fitness , and others think aesthetics is all that matter .

&gt;able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances

Every exercise I can think of can be done *at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances*.

&gt;resistance in many muscle groups

Eventually though you'll stop making strength gains and simply be increasing your endurance.
This is the fundamental problem with all body-weight exercises.

&gt;low-impact

Best for people with issues != best for people without issues or best overall.

&gt;whole-body

While it's important to workout your whole body , there is a reason that most weight-lifting routines isolate different areas , very few routines are whole body in 1 day .

&gt;another single form of exercise over swimming

If you mean a single exercise like a specific lift, I have to ask, which single method of swimming are you talking about?
If you mean a single type of exercise , weight lifting is by far the best .

As far as single lifts go , the squat is often referred to as one of the best .
It helps with flexibility , and works your legs and core quite hard .
It's also the most beneficial for older people since so much of their lives revolve around getting in and out of chairs ( there's an entire article I read about this once ).

Best regimen just depends on your goals .
That said, I think some of the better weight lifting routines are more efficient at achieving just about any goal you can think of, except cardiovascular endurance.


thank you, you've &#8710;'d my view by pointing out that 'best form of exercise' is pretty much meaningless .
