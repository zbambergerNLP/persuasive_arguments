T4	claim 304 382	Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.
A4	Type2 T4 evaluation_emotional
T5	claim 383 540	Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.
A5	Type2 T5 evaluation_rational
T6	claim 542 681	Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.
A6	Type2 T6 interpretation
T7	claim 682 849	Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life
A7	Type2 T7 interpretation
T8	premise 855 936	simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.
A8	Type3 T8 logos_pathos
T9	premise 1319 1538	I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.
A9	Type3 T9 logos_pathos
T10	claim 2253 2349	What you're really seeming to say is that any action which garners attention is morally corrupt.
A10	Type2 T10 interpretation
T11	claim 2350 2502	You've drawn this fine line where something that is done for attention cannot also be done for empowerment, which I find to be the crux of your dilemma.
A11	Type2 T11 interpretation
T12	premise 2503 2622	If someone is confident in their body, is it not empowering to have other people give you reassurance of that position?
A12	Type3 T12 logos_pathos
T13	premise 2623 2703	The definition of empowering is to "make (someone) stronger and more confident".
A13	Type3 T13 logos
T14	premise 2704 2764	If the feedback about their bodies does that, then so be it.
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	premise 2765 2865	People seem to get very morally judgmental about how the internet has made us all so much more open.
A15	Type3 T15 logos_pathos
T16	premise 2866 2950	We share so much and censor so much less... but why is this necessarily a bad thing?
A16	Type3 T16 logos_pathos
T17	premise 2951 3034	If  no harm is done, what problem is there in using the internet for such exchange?
A17	Type3 T17 logos_pathos
T18	premise 3035 3213	Like it or not, the platforms websites have provided have made a level playing field for anyone to find some kind of minor 'celebrity', with a paparazzi of their anonymous peers.
A18	Type3 T18 logos
T19	premise 3214 3287	If the attrition of that kind of fan base is what empowers her, so be it.
A19	Type3 T19 logos_pathos
T20	premise 3288 3430	It may be complex for those in relationships who want more exclusivity, but that's more an interpersonal problem than a denial of empowerment.
A20	Type3 T20 logos_pathos
T21	claim 3433 3510	I personally am against the openness that society has taken with the internet
A21	Type2 T21 evaluation_emotional
T22	claim 3511 3512	.
A22	Type2 T22 evaluation_emotional
T23	claim 3612 3711	I think that this openness is not detrimental per se, but is just a display of someone's character.
A23	Type2 T23 interpretation
T24	claim 3712 3770	Like I said, I have no*problem* with anyone posting nudes,
A24	Type2 T24 interpretation
T25	claim 3771 3837	I just immediately view them differently as one seeking attention.
A25	Type2 T25 interpretation
T26	premise 3838 3976	There are plenty of other ways to garner positive attention that everyone can agree is positive, instead of morally questionable behavior.
A26	Type3 T26 logos
T27	premise 4101 4185	Also, why is gaining a celebrity status for something like posting nudes empowering?
A27	Type3 T27 logos_pathos
T28	premise 4186 4226	What about that makes someone feel good?
A28	Type3 T28 logos_pathos
T29	claim 4227 4450	When I see that type of situation I see someone who knowingly is attractive, considering they have a high status, and is willing to sexually pleasure their followers via this attractiveness that they already know they have.
A29	Type2 T29 interpretation
T30	claim 4582 4693	I as a person have a hard time seeing through other people's eyes if I can't justify a logical reason to do it.
A30	Type2 T30 evaluation_emotional
T31	claim 4694 4747	I just don't see any reason in this type of behavior.
A31	Type2 T31 evaluation_rational
T32	premise 4748 4832	Also, I think that some of my problem is, like you said, the fine line I have drawn.
A32	Type3 T32 logos_pathos
T33	premise 4833 4952	The lines I tend to draw in life are ambiguous and hard to support which often results in a weak basis for my opinions.
A33	Type3 T33 logos
T34	premise 4953 4990	Hence, my seeking of others opinions.
A34	Type3 T34 logos_pathos
T35	claim 5160 5216	. And yet this is just the interplay of societal values.
A35	Type2 T35 interpretation
T36	premise 5217 5344	Let us not forget that during the Renaissance there was a huge movement for the exploration of the human form as a work of art.
A36	Type3 T36 logos
T37	premise 5345 5592	Much of the surviving ancient sculptures and paintings show the nakedness of the human form, and this art compares us to heroes and gods as did much of the writing and philosophy of the time as we tried to figure out our "meaning" in the universe.
A37	Type3 T37 ethos
T38	claim 5593 5743	Now of course, this is a romantic view of history which takes the surviving works of outstanding people, rather than looking towards the common man...
A38	Type2 T38 interpretation
T39	claim 5748 5815	certainly that is a point to be made about the modern time as well.
A39	Type2 T39 interpretation
T40	premise 5816 5862	What makes modern sexuality morally abhorrent?
A40	Type3 T40 logos_pathos
T41	premise 5863 5993	What logical basis is there for the rejection of the human form and the demonizing those who are open about their sexual identity?
A41	Type3 T41 logos_pathos
T42	premise 5994 6047	Slut shaming, or as you did, calling it as "whoring"?
A42	Type3 T42 logos_pathos
T43	claim 6049 6111	Certainly in America there is a huge bias against such things,
A43	Type2 T43 interpretation
T44	premise 6116 6357	the basis of that has been our periodic pushes from the church, periods of "Great Awakening" where fundamentalists have tried to restore us to some kind of repressive god-fearing and internalized state of self loathing and cleansing for sin.
A44	Type3 T44 ethos_logos
T45	claim 6358 6454	Beyond some shell of spirituality, there is no real objective reasoning to be so opposed to sex.
A45	Type2 T45 evaluation_rational
T46	premise 6455 6613	In fact if you look towards Europe, a lot of their media is much more lenient on sex than violence, whereas over here we're more lenient on violence than sex.
A46	Type3 T46 logos_pathos
T47	premise 6744 6904	The only ways I can think of are people trying to go back and find those pictures and use them against a person as some kind of ad-hominem attack in the public.
A47	Type3 T47 logos_pathos
T48	claim 6905 6992	This again, though, goes back to a culture which seems unreasonably biased towards sex.
A48	Type2 T48 evaluation_rational
T49	claim 6993 7123	There's this mystique and taboos surrounding it's open discussion which involve shaming and peer pressure, bullying and non-sense.
A49	Type2 T49 interpretation
T50	premise 7129 7302	Even you've admitted you can't really articulate it you just feel this way because you *just do*. Which is no basis for a logical or reasonable way to think about the world.
