CMV: EMTs, SAR, firefighters, police, etc. should receive “military discounts”.
For those of you who don’t know, it’s common (at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service.

It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers and that such discounts should be given to them.

As for the “They’re not risking their lives for our country.” argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests.
Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help, but that’s [usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate.

I&#8217;m really hoping there&#8217;s a good reason behind the status quo, but we&#8217;ll see.
[It looks like there’s even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually.]

What about teachers?
Scientists?
Doctors?
Farmers?
There are plenty of professions that do great things for society , but people aren't going around thanking them with discounts.


In that case, what makes soldiers more worthy than others?


I don't believe I ever argued that they were. Your premise is that these professions "do more good" than soldiers , and I'm asking why you don't want to extend the benefits to other critical pillars of our society.


I’ve since changed my view. Since you made the same argument that changed it, have a delta: Δ. I’ve edited my post to show my new view more accurately.
