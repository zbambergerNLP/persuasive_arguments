CMV - Mobile websites are a relic of the early mobile internet era and are inferior to actual websites when using your smartphone.

Full disclosure I use an iPhone but any smart phone can handle this.

There isn't a single instance where a mobile website is preferable to a full site .
The information is gutted and moved around making the site difficult to browse if it's something you are familiar with and less useful because the information is presented in a mobile-friendly way .
I believe smart phones are prevalent enough among phone users who want to use the Internet that it outweighs the "some people don't have smartphones" argument .
Change my view.

Edit 1: I would like to change my position a little to be "Websites should not default force mobile and have the option to go default and instead start default and allow mobile."

Edit 2: Is it typical of change my view to downvote the ops responses across the thread because you disagree with their view?
It's very off putting and doesn't encourage me, as op, to continue discussing my view .


As someone from a developing country, I would like to point out that mobile sites require less amount of data transfer to view than a desktop site which is a big thing for us due to slower Internet connections .


&#8710; I hadn't considered the obvious fact that web sites can be accessed globally and not everyone has the type of network the US enjoys .
