CMV: People who cheat on their spouses can and should, in some cases, be forgiven

There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact.
I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal , but in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.

There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that "sex with another person = relationship over" that I don't think hold up.

* **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end.
My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part.
Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

* **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end.
My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

* **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases , but other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. [
But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

* **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem , such as ... talking about the problem.
Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.

Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc.

Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship.
In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it .

I don't think this depends as much on the cheater as the person he/she cheated on.
Some people are unable to stay with an unfaithful partner and should not be pressured into continuing a relationship after that point.
Forgiveness depends on the forgiver, not the perpetrator.

Nobody "should" be forgiven for cheating , and I'm comfortable saying that anyone who knowingly betrays the trust of a relationship would deserve losing that relationship.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's expected to break up with the cheater , because some people are willing to be forgiving.
But I can't envision a situation where cheating "should" be forgiven.
Forgiveness is a gift, not an expectation.

This makes the most sense to me - very coherent argument.
Thanks!
