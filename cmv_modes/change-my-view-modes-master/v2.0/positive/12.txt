CMV: Eugenics isn't all that bad... And we don't even have to kill anyone for it

Okay, I'm talking about making the human race smarter, forever.
Intelligence is at least partially genetic and therefore passed down by parents , yes? [Yes.](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40459/title/Inherited-Intelligence/)

So, what if, instead of killing off the less-intelligent people ( I'm against killing.
Of most things.)
we just limit offspring?

For example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.
Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.

So someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring.
The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it.
A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.

Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.

This would eventually make the human race smarter , and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race.

I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do , but I'm just looking at the concept.
I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused ... I know all that.

Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit , or etc.
( If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one )

Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded?
Or maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.

Much better than "Kill off those with IQ less than 80"

I wouldn't mind a smarter human race...

EDIT: **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.**

EDIT 2: "**It looks to me like you've made so many exceptions to your main view that you aren't looking to have your view changed. I'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it's incorrect.**" -nikeson
I suppose that's true, now....


Firstly, IQ is not considered to be a good or accurate measure of overall intellect .
Intelligence is hard to define and describe even by neurologists and reducing that complexity down to one number is incredibly challenging if not impossible .

It may also be important to note that your system isn't only difficult to implement like you point out, it's also in direct conflict with how things actually work.
More intelligent people tend to have less children than do the more uneducated.
There are multiple reasons for this, more intelligent people tend to be more busy with careers, etc.

Lastly you must recognize that the IQ test is a standardized test.
This means that even if we went really extreme and killed everyone with an IQ under 80.....that would change nothing.
The average IQ will still be measured in the same way , the lowest scores will be assigned the lower numbers and the average will be the same .


Firstly, I mentioned that .
( "for want of better measure of intelligence" )
I would love a better measure of intelligence.
[ Some theorize that intelligence can be defined in categories, too...(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences)
So, maybe a complex way to combine them.
Like a total of all of them.
Idc.

I know about number two...
I'm not proposing we implement it .
In a perfect world, sure.
But at least my theory limits the offspring of less-intelligent people .
Less intelligent- less babies than contributors- less "less intelligent people" (and that would always be the case...)

I completely understand your distaste with the IQ test.
Again, I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is (seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence .
( better than SAT scores, right? )

And when the IQ test is adjusted, we would adjust the cutoff rate for "da murder" if we were to take that route in the first place.
( instead of killing lower than 80, it would be killing lower than like 50 or whatever )
The "number of mental retardation" would be adjusted from lower than 70 to whatever it would be, too, so I don't see your point there .
In total, everyone's IQ would be x points higher and so the human race would be x much smarter...
My route would be a slower, more ethical way to do it.


Separating intelligence into categories *is* a far better way to go about it , but by it's very nature implies you cannot sum them .
A brilliant mathematician make suck in all other areas such as music ability, linguistic skills, etc. making them look like a retard compared to a guy who is okay at math but also descent in those other categories.
The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it.
It is a complex ploygenic trait we still don't fully understand.
It is also downright silly to consider since, as we know it isn't really feasible to control the populations genitals in any ethical manner.

&gt; I only used the IQ test in my example because so far it is (seemingly) the most available measure of intelligence

This is not a good reason to use anything. I know it sucks but I have nothing better does not justify using a sucky measurement.


1.
Perhaps, but if we summed it, future generations would be on average smarter than past ones.
If we valued and weighted the categorical intelligences... Perhaps a brilliant mathematician would end up being (weighted) almost equal to a well rounded guy.

I also would like to add, hopefully if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence ( Pass down mathy skills of father and kinesthetic skills of mother or whatever )

&gt; (The point is intelligence is too complicated for us to try to breed certain kinds of it. It is a complex ploygenic trait we still don't fully understand.)

Eh, maybe we don't fully understand it, but we know that through breeding we can increase it, right?
Just because we don't understand every minute aspect of it doesn't mean we can't recognize what parts are positive and how to increase it.
Well hopefully it wouldn't be implemented in a way that forces you to do anything except stop having children after you reached the point where any more and you'd be hurting future generation's intelligence.
Let me clarify! You misinterpreted , I wouldn't advocate using the actual IQ scale as the starting measure of doing this at all , I used it as an example of an intelligence measure , and I meant most available as the "most available/recognizable example of intelligence"
I do not want our current IQ scale to be used in any way even close to this.


I think you are still oversimplifying it.
And no you can't just increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of the population .
Since we do not know the one to one correlations between a complex variety of genes and gene interactions and the vaguely defined intelligence that they produce you cannot feasibly do this.
What if someone with a low intellect (however the hell you measure it) and high intellect want to breed?

Also, only one of my parents finished high school.
I am their 6th child.
I have a Masters degree.
( See my user history for reference ).
We don't know all of the complex genetic and environmental elements that go into intellect to do anything remotely like what you are describing.

&gt; I also would like to add, hopefully if we learn more about genetics and genetic engineering we would be able to selectively breed intelligence

I, like some of the other commentators here, find the hypothetical game to be intellectually dishonest.
The "Yeah but what if..." thing just isn't going to fly.
It is not conducive to a productive conversation of this sort.


Well if someone of low intellect wanted to breed with someone of high intellect, their children count would be limited by the lower children count.
Later in life, if higher intellect person wants more children, they can, only if they don't have a genetic contributor from someone who already fulfilled their amount?

I think you could increase intelligence through controlling the breeding rights of a population.
I don't think its feasible, though...

Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ ( which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are )

We don't know all , true, but we know some , which should be enough to increase intelligence .

Maybe the hypothetical game is annoying and not productive, but its not intellectually dishonest...
I'm sorry, maybe I shouldn't have posted this topic.
I posted with the actual intent of proving that a hypothetical situation could have eugenics be good.

*shrug* in the end, are we agreeing that
1. Eugenics is not realistically feasible
2.
But in a hypothetical world where it is feasible, it would be a good thing
?


Eugenics would work if eugenics worked.
That's basically all you've said.
Which is basically like saying if unicorns were real, they would be real.

&gt; Congrats on your degree, but degrees are no more a measure of intelligence than IQ (which kind of is, meaning degrees kind of are)

No
. I think you'll find someone who has a degree in topic X is a much better indicator of their holistic intellectual ability with respect to category X than a simple reductive IQ test.


Yes and yes and sorry :/
&#8710;

Edit: My view was changed when Namemedickles pointed out how basically my argument depended on changing everything about how something could be implemented to the point of where it is impossible
&gt;Eugenics would work if eugenics worked. That's basically all you've said.
