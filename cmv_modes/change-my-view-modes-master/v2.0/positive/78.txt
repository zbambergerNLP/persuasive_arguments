CMV: The highest form of relationship between men and women doomed to be romance

Maybe it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex , but I'm beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.

"Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?" I wonder ( my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss's *The Game* ).
" Why do I feel like chasing after girls and getting to know them when I have so many great guy friends already who I know care about me so much more? Why can't I be friends with girls (even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I don't try to advance some romantic agenda?
Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them? "

I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships, but instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read, I ask just the one title question (thinking that the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding ) because I want to know what older, more mature people think .
It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy's school for the majority of my life.

At times, I feel like the interplay between men and women is always (at least always initially) a bs game where the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner .
Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me that I can't stand it .
Please change this view.


Id just like to point out that this has never remotely seemed the case from my perspective as a lesbian .
Beyond that, there are many people who want close relationships without romance , an obvious example would be asexual people .
They can have close relationships that rival that of marriage , but how would you even quantify that ?
How can you even compare them?
What about the relationship of a brother and sister?

If you limit it to just heterosexual non-related men and women , then maybe you're right , but then again who is to say what form of relationship is the highest, two very close lifetime friends who are platonic or a married couple?

The bottom line is that people are different from you can relationships are hard to compare .
Maybe for you, every relationship with a woman is motivated by romance.
For someone other hetero guy it might not be.
Sexual attraction is not something that just shuts off so even if you're in a lifelong comitted closed relationship you'll still probably feel attraction for other people .
Thats just reality for most people , and its not necesarily harmful and its not really shallow.

There are very few absolutes when it comes to interpersonal relationships.

In short, I don't need to feel guilty when I'm attracted to people I know I can't have?
Maybe I'm too black-and-white to think that the murmurs of my id are natural and not evil .

As for which relationship is *higher* from a quantifiable standpoint, I see what you mean .
When I said highest, I meant it not from a perspective of quantity of some sort , but of a level of worth .
Looking at that statement, however, I think you're right again-- who is to put a romantic relationship above a friendship?

It's a bit extreme and morbid , but if I were to put someone's spouse and someone's absolute best friend in front of a train and gave that person one to save, whom would they save?
Maybe I just find that once I reach a certain threshold with a guy-friend, I find that we become best friends , but when I reach that threshold with a girl-friend, I find that I want more .
Maybe I haven't been around the block enough or had enough female friends to feel this way .
I don't have any lesbian friends (as far as I know at least) , so I don't know how I would react to being great friends with one.
