T5	premise 462 635	For example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.
A5	Type3 T5 logos
T6	premise 636 765	Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.
A6	Type3 T6 logos
T7	premise 767 909	So someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring.
A7	Type3 T7 logos_pathos
T8	premise 910 996	The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it.

A27	Type2 T27 disagreement
