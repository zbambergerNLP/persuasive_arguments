CMV The EGG came first before the chicken.

According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken .
Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature.
Let's call it X.
Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken , but at some point it does .
An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg.
The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist.
Am I wrong?

PS I'm playing laser tag soon so I will respond in 20ish minutes.

In terms of evolution, the question is erroneous.
The ancestral organism from which the chicken is derived never gave bith to a chicken egg.
There is no sharp line representing a single generation that became chickens.
The newly defined chicken species (a species is hard enough to define as it is) is not recognized as a new species of chickens until you already have an independently reproducing population.
Though there were ancestral species that produced eggs, due to the gradual process that produces what we call new species and how we define them, there was never a single egg that gave rise to the first chicken.

While the dividing line between species is quite arbitrary , if scientists had enough evidence a distinction would be made.
Species are labeled by humans, but really we are all similar life.
Where ever the distinction would be made, wouldn't that make the egg first?

And if you define a species as an independently reproducing population I think both comes at the same time.
An independently reproductive community of animals should only be defined as such once their chicken babies are layed or hatched.
When that happens the egg becomes a chicken egg and the X becomes a chicken.

You sort of C'd my V.

I'll give you a delta once I go learn how.
