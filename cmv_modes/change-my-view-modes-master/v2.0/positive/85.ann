A1	Type1 T1 evaluation_rational
T2	claim 202 231	Networking is discriminatory.
A2	Type2 T2 evaluation_rational
T3	premise 239 428	A "standard" hiring method would ensure that every applicant would be evaluated on the same criteria - the satisfaction of requirements of the position and merits relevant to that position.
A3	Type3 T3 ethos_logos_pathos
T4	premise 436 671	Who an applicant knows is occasionally useful for those jobs which require maintaining relationships with certain people in key positions (e.g. sales), but for the vast majority of jobs, who your friends are is functionally irrelevant.
A4	Type3 T4 ethos_logos_pathos
T5	premise 679 946	Allowing someone to circumvent the standard application process ("jumping the line") or to use some important person's recommendation as additional clout for their application ("came very highly recommended by Bob") is preferential treatment for irrelevant qualities.

T6	claim 956 1092	I recognize and appreciate that it is difficult in most employment processes to find individuals who are trustworthy, socially apt, etc.
A6	Type2 T6 evaluation_rational

A7	Type3 T7 logos
T8	claim 1226 1363	Networking, as a practice, favors individuals who come from already socially favorable situations, moreso than other evaluation criteria.
A8	Type2 T8 evaluation_rational
T9	premise 1371 1605	Beyond straight nepotism, it is self-evident that individuals who come from families and backgrounds which allow for more interaction with individuals in power will be able to call on more of those individuals for networking purposes.
A9	Type3 T9 logos_pathos
T10	premise 1613 1810	Individuals who are extraordinarily qualified for a position but come from a region/social background without those connections enter a networking-friendly employment opportunity at a disadvantage.
A10	Type3 T10 logos_pathos

A11	Type2 T11 evaluation_rational

A12	Type3 T12 pathos
T13	claim 2126 2234	Businesses and societies would be better off disallowing networking from influencing their hiring decisions.
A13	Type2 T13 evaluation_emotional
T14	claim 2242 2399	If a hiring process takes networking into account, it is necessarily showing preference to individuals who already come from advantaged background, as per 2.
A14	Type2 T14 interpretation
T15	premise 2400 2504	This decreases social/economic mobility, which has been demonstrated to be bad for societies in general.
A15	Type3 T15 logos
T16	premise 2512 2789	If the egalitarian hiring process in-place is so ineffective at determining qualifications/character that it must depend on recommendations from trusted sources to establish merit, the productivity of any positions where such a trusted source does not come forward will suffer.

A17	Type3 T17 logos_pathos
T18	claim 2844 2956	"this is how the world works," and many feel at ease participating in networking events without any moral qualms
