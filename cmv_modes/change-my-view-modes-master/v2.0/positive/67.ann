A8	Type3 T8 pathos
T9	claim 1548 1584	unfit to fairly criticize the series
A9	Type2 T9 evaluation_emotional
T10	premise 1614 1721	I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was
A10	Type3 T10 logos_pathos
T11	claim 1826 1935	the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters
A11	Type2 T11 interpretation
T12	premise 1938 2096	With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard's crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities.
A12	Type3 T12 ethos_pathos
T13	premise 2126 2318	seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career.
A13	Type3 T13 logos_pathos
T14	premise 2330 2556	the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material.
A14	Type3 T14 logos_pathos
T15	premise 2558 2631	Without these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 didn't live up to the hype
A15	Type3 T15 logos
T16	premise 2648 2747	It's such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide.
A16	Type3 T16 ethos_pathos
T17	claim 2763 2830	it's a complete waste of the player's time going about it that way.
A17	Type2 T17 evaluation_rational
T18	claim 2886 2968	there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies.
A18	Type2 T18 evaluation_rational
T19	claim 4058 4115	if the material is in the game, it's there for a purpose.
A19	Type2 T19 interpretation
T20	premise 4116 4181	It was there to be seen by players and to be experienced by them.
A20	Type3 T20 logos
T21	premise 4182 4235	And sometimes, tragedies are more fun than victories.
A21	Type3 T21 pathos
T22	claim 4237 4268	I did do the completionist run!
A22	Type2 T22 agreement
T23	premise 4269 4459	I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not.
A23	Type3 T23 pathos
T24	premise 4460 4490	It went - well, okay, I guess.
A24	Type3 T24 logos_pathos
T25	claim 4492 4550	However, after that, I wanted some real emotional punches.
A25	Type2 T25 evaluation_emotional
T26	premise 4917 4997	I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense.
A26	Type3 T26 pathos
T27	premise 5272 5343	And so I made the world's giantest asshole most self-justifying Shepard
A27	Type3 T27 logos_pathos
T28	premise 5365 5431	It's about as far as you can get from *your* completionist Shepard
A28	Type3 T28 logos_pathos
T29	premise 5438 5502	taken with ME3's ending, I think it makes for a far better story
A29	Type3 T29 logos_pathos
T30	premise 5505 5699	A renegade lady who wasn't *xenophobic* as much as *very* pro-human, straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests (and who killed Kaidan in ME1, woops).
A30	Type3 T30 logos
T31	premise 5700 5785	Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in.
A31	Type3 T31 logos_pathos
T32	claim 5797 6207	when you play a character who's a lot more of an asshole but who's a really *determined* asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it's *worth* something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary (when you, the player, know that they aren't) - the 'bad ends' in ME3 make for a fantastic experience.
A32	Type2 T32 disagreement
T33	premise 6208 6301	It's basically the game going 'well Shepard, you fucked up, and this is what you get for it'.
A33	Type3 T33 pathos
T34	claim 6303 6348	They're not hollow at all, they're fantastic.
A34	Type2 T34 evaluation_emotional
T35	premise 6349 6511	The entire game and story turns into Shepard realizing too late that things could've been different and that the state of the universe going to shit is on *them*.
A35	Type3 T35 pathos
T36	premise 6599 6835	The finale of ME3 goes from a completely unsatisfying throughly annoying ending that ignored the themes of choice and self-determination that had been going on through the game into one final, desperate chance to make it right, instead.
A36	Type3 T36 logos_pathos
T37	premise 6837 7104	Whatever Shepard picks, I felt a lot more satisfied with *that* story as a whole instead of the 'no one dies' run where it didn't really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that - just pick choice A, B or C and that's your ending for you.
A37	Type3 T37 logos_pathos
T38	premise 7106 7248	Shitty failure Shepard's ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she'd burned and destroyed anything else around her
A38	Type3 T38 pathos
T39	claim 7347 7502	To me, that kind of ending fit much better with the way I'd played her, and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it.
A39	Type2 T39 interpretation
T40	premise 7503 7607	Every other *possible* ending that could've been, she'd gone and wrecked through her own shitty actions.
A40	Type3 T40 logos_pathos
T41	premise 7608 7701	Losing all the choices at the end made *sense*, this time, in the context of her experiences.
A41	Type3 T41 pathos
T42	claim 7776 7962	the 'everyone dies' route, seeing as it *is* there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that's screwed up the whole way
A42	Type2 T42 evaluation_emotional
T43	premise 7965 8163	I don't think of it as *me* killing of those characters off, it's whatever Shepard I'm playing in that particular runthrough that's doing it - a vicious, angry, bitter and ultimately futile Shepard.
A43	Type3 T43 ethos_logos
T44	premise 8164 8338	The emotional payoff on finishing the series went from 'are you serious is that actually the ending, the fuck' to 'HAHA YES, Shepard fucking deserved that, that was *great*'.
A44	Type3 T44 logos
T45	claim 8347 8469	The right way to play it is to experience everything that is there, and then figure out what makes you the most satisfied.
A45	Type2 T45 evaluation_emotional
T46	premise 8470 8510	For me, that wasn't a completionist run.
A46	Type3 T46 logos_pathos
T47	claim 8685 8869	The one I find the most hilarious and interesting is the one whose story makes the most sense as a whole, and that's the one where Shepard totally fails save anyone, including herself.
