CMV: Assuming there is no afterlife, then life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die.

*Note: Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post.
I am not religious.
Thank you.
ALSO: By "meaningless," I mean "meaningless" to the person who is doing the dying.
To the person who is alive and who will then die, life is meaningless.

CMV.
Assuming there is no afterlife , life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die .
Death is the great eraser .
Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory .
It is comparable to that, too .

It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die .
Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness .
Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing .
To me, it is as if my life had never happened .

I'll put it another way.
Imagine the time before you were born .
Have you remembered it yet?
Of course not .
You didn't exist .
This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth .
When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness , and I return to it permanently . I might as well have never lived .

To anticipate a few responses:

(1) Helping others doesn't matter .
They will die too .
And then their descendants will die, on and on and on , until eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death .
Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me , assuming they all die , then my life is still pointless and meaningless .
For I will be dead and won't know what I did , and once they die, they won't know either .

(2) Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal."
I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness .
Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame .

(3) Enjoying the moment is possible , but doesn't make life have a point .
For once I die, all memories and all point is gone .

Please change my view from this depressing sentiment.


I have contemplated this since I was a young teen and often made me wonder why so many people are concerned with leaving a "legacy".
If existence (from your perspective) lies solely on your consciousness then after you die it doesn't matter what you left because it no longer exists since you cannot experience it.
In a metaphysical sense you could argue that we essentially never exist.
This of course is assuming that death is an elimination of existence which is beyond what anybody truly knows.
It is a bit depressing but can also be quite liberating as you can free yourself from society's many irrational norms and expectations.

As for things having meaning, from this standpoint you can create your own meaning.
May as well enjoy life while you temporarily exist.

Your bleak view reminds me of the Queen line from Bohemian Rhapsody, "I don't wanna die. I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all."
Never being born is essentially the same as being dead, you just never have the conscious mind to experience the fear of contemplating it.
I guess it comes down to what you think is worse. Never experiencing life or living in fear of death.


I want to give you a âˆ†, so here you go.
You've been most successful because you changed the "depressed" part of my view, albeit only a bit.
Enjoying life EVEN THOUGH I temporarily exist will be my new mindset.
I don't know if I'll be able to get there, but we'll see.
