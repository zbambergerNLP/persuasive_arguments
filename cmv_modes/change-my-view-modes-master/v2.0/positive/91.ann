A8	Type3 T8 logos
T9	premise 876 920	it seriously strains credulity to begin with
A9	Type3 T9 logos
T10	premise 924 999	Even miracles make more sense in the context of the birth of the Son of God
A10	Type3 T10 logos

A12	Type3 T12 logos
T13	premise 1209 1430	Plus Mary and Joseph would be the first to know when something came available since they were basically squatting in the garage and would surely notice when patrons came to get their ox or camel or whatever before leaving
A13	Type3 T13 logos_pathos
T14	claim 1434 1638	The obvious implication is that Jesus' chintzy Jewish stepdad was such a tightwad that he was willing to let his pubescent wife and her newborn baby sleep in donkey slop if it would save him a few shekels
A14	Type2 T14 interpretation
T15	premise 1641 1815	Joseph probably would have made that barn the family's permanent rent-free residence if the wise men hadn't showed up bearing enough cash and prizes to go live it up in Egypt
