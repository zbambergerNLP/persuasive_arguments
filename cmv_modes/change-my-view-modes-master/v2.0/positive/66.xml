Full disclosure I use an iPhone but any smart phone can handle this.

<claim type="evaluation_rational" id="0" rel="support" ref="title">There isn't a single instance where a mobile website is preferable to a full site</claim>.
<premise type="pathos" id="1" rel="support" ref="title">The information is gutted and moved around</premise> <premise type="pathos" id="2" rel="support" ref="title">making the site difficult to browse if it's something you are familiar with</premise> and <premise type="pathos" id="3" rel="support" ref="title">less useful because the information is presented in a mobile-friendly way</premise>.
I believe <premise type="logos_pathos" id="4" rel="support" ref="5">smart phones are prevalent enough among phone users who want to use the Internet</premise> that <claim type="evaluation_rational" id="5" rel="support" ref="title">it outweighs the "some people don't have smartphones" argument</claim>.

As someone from a developing country, I would like to point out that <claim type="evaluation_emotional" id="8" rel="undercutter" ref="title">mobile sites require less amount of data transfer to view than a desktop site</claim> <premise type="logos" id="9" rel="support" ref="8">which is a big thing for us due to slower Internet connections</premise>.
