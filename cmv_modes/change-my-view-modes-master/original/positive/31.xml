Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults. They will care about how people respond to them, but since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity.

Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality, and people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group. Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups.

On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof. Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors, ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact.
It will reach conspiracy theory levels of "proof" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.

Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.

I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative, but that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site.

Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.

To be fair that's not specific to 4chan and that phenomenon has been around forever(Tumblr's community is heavily guilty of this same thing).  It's also a product of individual stupidity, if your believing something random people are telling you without it being backed by proof and your own individual research, well that's your own gullibility.


As for 4chan making people into a worse person, I would strong disagree.  I'd say more it just lets people be free, free to test the waters and do whatever without your idea's, jokes, concepts tied to any identity.  Every thought stands of its own individual merits.


I've been around 4chan since 2004 and the only way I would ever describe it would be *chaotic neutral*.  One day groups from or within it might organize some raid for the lolz, [another day they're saving a kitten,](http://www.inquisitr.com/18170/4chan-b-goes-after-cat-abusers-wins/)

I've honestly seen more positive activism stem from the anonymity culture than I have from any other site.

The problem is a lot of people only understand the surface of chan boards like 4chan and equate the anonymity as some cheap way for them to be hateful under the guise of free speech, but that couldn't really be further from the truth.  


To understand why the board encourages to *hate* is to understand who goes there and it's obviously the social outcasts.  So why would a bunch of social outcasts who get made fun of encourage hate and let such raw emotion reign supreme?  Quite honestly it dilutes it.  Getting called a *faggot* on 4chan constantly helps you to brush it off when you hear it on the street, and the nice thing about the anonymity of the 4chan board is essentially you have a new identity with each post letting you brush it off even more.  That last post you made someone made fun of you, well cool no one knows that the person who just made the post people are laughing at was the same post they were making fun of.  You're no longer the *faggot* you're the *comedian* until you make a new post and you're the *troll*.

4chan style sites don't create pessimistic, negative, and depressed people it just attracts them and quite honestly it's nice to be able to show raw emotion and not have it permanently tied to your identity.  You never have to worry about people being like "oh that dude, that dude always has problems -ignored-"

I've used 4chan a bunch of times to let out my problems about being depressed, suicidal and raped.  It's wonderful because I can let it all out and continue to be a member of that community without the community permanently tying what happened to me to my identity.
If I fully discussed my rape irl i was always going to feel broken because everyone I talked to would then associate it with my identity and it would be something I would never escape.  Even on reddit i was originally hesitant to be open about it because of the username system would tie it to my reddit identity.  But on 4chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief.  In real life you don't know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen, you don't know if they're just being kind and don't truly care, but on 4chan style board, if no one cares they're not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and don't force anyone to carry their past with them.

It's the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn't drag them around to each *new thing* we do but instead move on and start over.

It's this aspect that attracts the people you describe, the site however doesn't create these people it merely attracts them and for many like myself, helps them get out of that mindset in their real life. 

I've been browsing that site for 10 years, and arguably i'm more optimistic and positive because i've been exposed to that raw humanity.


I wrote all of this in all honesty not thinking anything would change your view based on your last sentence.

&gt;Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.

As it seems you hold the belief that even if people like myself don't feel they are being effected by this site negatively, you are insisting they are and are just ignorant to their own emotions and experiences.

**edit**: my terrible grammar

∆ A lot of good arguments have been made but I think you brought up some other valid points that others didn't.

I think another thing is that over the years the sense of humor has just been lost to me. I don't feel like calling someone a fag is all that funny anymore and I don't want to be in on the joke, so I end up taking things seriously instead.
