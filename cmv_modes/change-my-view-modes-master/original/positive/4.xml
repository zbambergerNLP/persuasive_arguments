<title>CMV:Essential Oils are bullshit</title>

My wife has recently gotten deeply involved/obsessed with the healing properties of essential oils.  I am cursed with a common problem in that I am an extremely skeptical person.  I can't help but look at this product and see a pyramid scheme that takes advantage of the gullible.  All the shit my wife watches on these oils is carefully worded to make sure they don't make actual healing claims, I'm told this is because they aren't FDA approved and could get in trouble.  I've looked a little and haven't found anything debunking these oils but i still cannot help but feel they are total BS.  I would love to get more information from unbiased sources on this.  

Please change my view without just anecdotal testimonies.

[This answer in /r/askscience does a pretty good job of describing essential oils.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2pp57r/how_effective_are_essential_oils/cmytzdq) As the comment points out there are benefits to essential oils if they are used in the right way.  However, the current fad mixes the raw essential oils with other stuff that may or may not be good for you.  The raw essential oils are actually "a vital resource for drug discovery."

&amp;#8710; While my view may not have shifted enough for me to avoid pissing my wife off, I have to say that you really brought home the bacon on this one and gave me some hope for the oils.  thank you for your response.
