There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973.    
                 
Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion.  
              
These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up.   
           
Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million.                         
One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems. Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues.  
            
America's innovation and education rankings would be lower. Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around. 
                        
(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)         
               
**Was view changed?**  
Its a complicated issue. Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population?  Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange, meaning that it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive? Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics?          -(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-   
        
                 
(Side thought: Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children. Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons, but surely its a significant number, so how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower? This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value. Conclusion: Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding. *no that isn't a serious sentiment, i'm just saying, this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* )    
                          
Then there is the next question. Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems, or would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit? Similar: An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus, but in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not.
            
Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one. This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country.  Modern technology like the internet must be considered.
                 
             
Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost.                  
           
            
**EDIT:** 
             
I'll be without internet for a few days. I may end up returning and responding more but it won't be anytime soon.   
             
This was my first post to CMV. I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. I also see a few times where I got redundant. 
          
Thank you all for your arguments. This is a very critical place, I hope to learn how to better use it and come here more often. I feel I could learn a lot here.

If the abortions were born it would have virtually negated the need for immigration, both legal and illegal, in order to maintain age demographics and keep social security viable.  Low paying jobs would be held by English-speaking Americans instead of unintelligible foreigners, which would make for a more uniform, cohesive society.  Not to mention less communication issues when dealing with these workers day to day.

This post made it aware that there are not enough lesser educated people being born in this society to complete enough hands-on jobs to support the educated population. While you can still continue the argument from here for a long enough time to get a head ache, I think that such an answer is as definite as you can give. My main line of thinking was that we don't economically need more people being raised from poverty, and this disproved that.
