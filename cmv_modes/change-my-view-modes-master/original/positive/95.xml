<title>CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.</title>

I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries, the far-left has for the most part been dealt with. However the far-right continues to be a menace.

I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes, and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place.

Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.

Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty, such leaders are given a free hand. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. Wouldn't restricting "free speech" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?

Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.

Instead, I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism. After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies.

Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough, and their will always be a few bad apples. These bad apples need to be weeded out. Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society.

As other's said, who gets to decide what these bad ideologies are.  Here's a substitution using your syntax, but modified details.

&gt;Zero tolerance, whatever it takes.
Schools should educate children on the dangers of jewish zionism and their poison should be kept out of the minds of children. Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination.
In a highly connected online era, it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement. When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem.
The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough.

Now, this is obviously extreme, but you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness.

The thing is though, what is considered a political fringe isn't really all that subjective.

Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous.

I don't disagree, but on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is?  Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous, and probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable.  Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office.

Well we have the benefit of history. The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center.

In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out. Pre-WW2 germany or Stalinist Russia weren't all that stable.

So did they.  Tyrants and tyranny are as old as politics themselves.  Ever heard of the Reign of Terror?  

&gt;The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center.

And who gets to decide what being a moderate was, and why is it tied to what the majority wants?  Todays moderates are tomorrows conservatives, and throughout history the majority has been okay with a lot of terrible shit.

Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening?  It seems a need for censorship implies a certain degree of exposure to these ideas.  Also, stable democracies have elected terrible people too who have done terrible things.  100 years of reasonable people who likely were considered moderates lead a persecution of Indians from the Trial of Tears to Wounded Knee.

But hasn't most of the world moved past the age of tyrannical rulers ? Genocide is something most of the world has moved past, and only a few extremist individuals try to advocate it.

I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives. However this isn't about being just a bit conservative. It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.

Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.

There will always be evil people that bring misery to the world. Why is it wrong to try and stop them ?

People thought the exact same thing before WWI.  They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years.  And I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east.  Hell, Rwanda wasn't that long ago either. And even beyond tyranny the west seems complicit in a global order that directly leads to many deaths of the worlds poor each day that they could have prevented.  

&gt;I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives. However this isn't about being just a bit conservative. It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder.

One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. One's person's genocide is another person's defense of their culture.  One person's murderer is a other's soldier.  Now, I don't think all these comparisons are true, but they certainly aren't hard to make.  And they certainly have been made throughout history.  

&gt;Conservatives don't do this, it's extremists.

Exactly, my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes.  It isn't some objective fact about people.  J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote, but today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought.  The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone, and to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction (either failing to get bad people or getting good people)

Your first paragraph is intriguing, and I definitely agree with it. The freedom fighter/terrorist comparison is also an interesting perspective. Although I do think more needs to be done to combat extremism, I see where you're coming from on this.
