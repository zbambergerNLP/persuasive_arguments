<title>CMV: Irony aside, most people that post in CMV are uneducated, and changing their view on one point won't solve this overall problem</title>

There are some instances, yes where controversial topics are discussed here and people are actually interested in hearing the opposite side. I consider myself one of those people, and was initially driven to this subreddit in the hope that I would meet other people like myself that were posting here to educate themselves. The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.

But far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday's [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.

And the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.

Additionally, the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already, even before submitting. Go ahead, think of something you believe that is controversial and click "Submit CMV." Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this: it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.

Thanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post, albeit maybe not today, and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.

Quick edit: I realized I didn't address the second part of my title claim. Albert Einstein said that 2 things are limitless: the universe and human stupidity. For every stupid person that posts on this sub to address one point of their lack of knowledge, there are foreseeably dozens more points of misunderstanding that remain. What is the overall aim of this subreddit? To educate one at a time, indeed. But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed. This is a real debate: anything else is just convincing a stupid person of something that they fail to understand.

Say you're right, and most of the people who post here are incapable of actually changing their view on the subject they're bringing up (I don't believe this is the case most of the time, but just for the sake of argument). It would still be false to say that nobody ever changes their view, though. People have deltas awarded to them, and those signify that somewhere out there, somebodies mind was changed. Maybe it was insignificant, maybe it was only changed for a brief moment before some argument changed it back. Regardless, people do change their views here sometimes, and that's a result of them taking the time to examine their views in light of others'. I view that as intrinsically good, the search for knowledge and the refinement of your own belief system, these things make you a better, more educated and well-rounded person. 

You said it was a waste of time because most people's views aren't changed, or aren't changed enough, but I wouldn't say that makes it a waste of time. The mere act of getting someone to evaluate their own views and challenge them is a good thing to get in the habit of. You have to start somewhere, so to speak. Even if it's about the most insignificant of things, or even if they didn't change their mind at all, it's still a positive step for that person to try.

Second, it sometimes goes the other way. Just because OP doesn't change his mind doesn't mean someone reading the comments hasn't. I've read several posts where I went in disagreeing with OP, but after reading the arguments in favor of their arguments, I've come out with a different point of view. I had no part in the discussion, no comments were made, no deltas awarded, but someone's view was changed.

Maybe it feels like slogging through shit sometimes, but if you can get someone to think critically about their own beliefs even for a second, isn't that a good thing?

I'll give you the âˆ† on the waste of time point, which, frankly, was not so well worded on my part. It is fair to argue that even if OP does not change his mind, some people in the comments will. But I disagree with your first paragraph: just because deltas are awarded does not mean anything. As I said, controversial issues exist where both points are valid exist, and these posts are likely to dispense deltas liberally. The fact that deltas are awarded alone does not justify whether the time spent convincing a stupid person of a single point was time well spent.
