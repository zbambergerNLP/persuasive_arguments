While obviously a balanced exercise regimen is the best choice for health and well-being, if someone were forced to stick to a single exercise technique, there is no reason other than lack of availability to choose anything other than swimming. Swimming is:

A) cardio, able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances, making it suitable for a wide range of fitness levels

B) resistance in many muscle groups, especially when strokes in question are varied and tools such as fins or kickboards are added

C) low-impact, making it suitable for older people, people with recent injuries, or those with longer-term joint problems

D) whole-body (or at least most-of-the-body)

With all that said and considered, is there any reason to choose another **single** form of exercise over swimming, other than lack of accessible facilities (EDIT: or physical inability to swim)?

Edit 2: view changed, because "best form of exercise" is actually meaningless.

Exercise regimens depend entirely on your goals. Do you want to improve your cardiovascular health? Cardio. Do you want to work on aesthetics? Weights. Do you want to increase your physical strength? Weights. Best in terms of time investment? Weights. Best in terms of monetary investment? Walking. People have different goals, some thing running a marathon is the pinnacle of fitness, others think 5 plate deads are a better example of fitness, and others think aesthetics is all that matter. 

&gt;able to be done at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances

Every exercise I can think of can be done *at a variety of speeds over a variety of distances*.

&gt;resistance in many muscle groups

Eventually though you'll stop making strength gains and simply be increasing your endurance. This is the fundamental problem with all body-weight exercises.

&gt;low-impact

Best for people with issues != best for people without issues or best overall.

&gt;whole-body 

While it's important to workout your whole body, there is a reason that most weight-lifting routines isolate different areas, very few routines are whole body in 1 day.

&gt;another single form of exercise over swimming

If you mean a single exercise like a specific lift, I have to ask, which single method of swimming are you talking about? If you mean a single type of exercise, weight lifting is by far the best.

As far as single lifts go, the squat is often referred to as one of the best. It helps with flexibility, and works your legs and core quite hard. It's also the most beneficial for older people since so much of their lives revolve around getting in and out of chairs (there's an entire article I read about this once).

Best regimen just depends on your goals. That said, I think some of the better weight lifting routines are more efficient at achieving just about any goal you can think of, except cardiovascular endurance.

thank you, you've âˆ†'d my view by pointing out that 'best form of exercise' is pretty much meaningless.
