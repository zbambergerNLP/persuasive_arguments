I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not "blaming" the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a "worthwhile endeavor" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and "explaining causation" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as "part 1" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term "causation" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that "avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that "explaining causation is not victim blaming", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think "explaining causation" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

I think you're correct for the most part, but still believe I can change your view a bit due to adding an emotional component you may not be considering due to inexperience with some situations. I want to note I don't think this inexperience makes you a bad person or an idiot, it's just data you may not have to put into consideration. While speaking about causation can be beneficial in a vacuum, there is an overall context that may make it harmful, and when and how you discuss it can lead to it being potentially more damaging than helpful.

When I entered my friend's room after they called me about being assaulted, I found them sobbing and repeating to themself "I'm so stupid." They had invited someone they didn't know very well into their room - something just about everyone I've known has done multiple times - and, in this case, it turned out for the worst.

If someone had come in and said to my friend, "well, inviting someone into your room is a risky thing to do," then I wouldn't be frustrated with that person because they were wrong, I would be frustrated with them because they were being emotionally inconsiderate. Yes, there were logical decisions on my friend's part that put them at risk, but my friend is already dealing with emotionally damaging self-blaming and self-loathing, and this just throws fuel on the fire. When someone is unable to leave a room for 3 weeks because of waking up in the middle of the night sobbing and having flashbacks, you pointing out how they could have lessened their chance of this occurring is not on the top of the list of things that need to be addressed. Later, when that person is speaking with a trusted therapist who can unwind causality from self-blame, is a more appropriate context to discuss the the issue with that person.

I'd equate it to walking up to someone whose dog was hit by a car and saying, "dog-chains will keep the dog away from the street and make it less likely to be hit by a car." You're not logically wrong, but you're not really helping. By pointing out the causality to the owner - who is likely already blaming themself - you're likely hurting them more than your information is worth. In addition, you're not fully informed; for all you know, the owner's last dog strangled itself on its chain, and he just put in a fence that the new dog dug under. This is why there are commenters in this thread who are saying people are being unempathetic; they're not seeing the emotional context of the event, and just focusing on the logical context - considering the causality in a vacuum instead of as part of a whole incident. Again, this is not because they're stupid, but because they likely have never had a full context on an issue like this before.

This is not to say that conversations shouldn't be had about dangerous areas, or that people shouldn't be warned about dangerous activities; those things lead to better-informed citizens and better policing, as well as other endeavors such as improved lighting for areas that are high-crime. However, there needs to be a question of when and with whom that conversation should be had; in cases like sexual assualt, I think the causation argument should be had with the therapist. People who see it on the news and say it, especially without the full context, are potentially doing more damage to the person than they are helping, without realizing it.

This is a good point, and it's been mentioned elsewhere (I intend to give the Delta elsewhere as well - I've never awarded oen before, so hopefully this works). This changes my view slightly about the latter part of my general view - "it's a worthwhile endeavor". There are certain situations, of course, when "explaining causation" simply demonstrates a lack of empathy - and it's those situations that demand the most care and empathy in the first place. I was probably speaking a little too broadly in my original post, because that's definitely something I agree with, but I think you deserve a Delta for a well-reasoned and rational argument that's driven not just from logic but from a sense of compassion.
