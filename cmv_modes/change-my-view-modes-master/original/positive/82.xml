Let me make this clear before I continue, I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like.  I don't care if people post nudes, I'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes.  Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.  Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.

Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.  Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life, or simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.  

Specifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend (hence the throwaway) , have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with "it makes me feel good."  Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either don't have an answer or somehow deay it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body.  I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.  

So reddit, why do people post nudes?  I seriously can't grasp the concept in a way that justifies this action, and have come into conflict with female friends and my gf and would like to be able to see this from another angle.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT:  Thank you for all of the replies!  You guys pointed out some clearly fallacious opinions I had and also showed me a multitude of other views on the issue.  This is a very personal issue that only pertains to my own beliefs and not something I go around spouting to others.  This was a good learning experience for myself, so again thank you all.  I have deltas to those I felt really stuck with the discussion, but I'd like to thank you all for commenting.

It depends on the person. One person can be incredibly confident with his/her private parts. Therefore, the person is eager to show off and get some attention. However, most people are not quite as endowed or gifted as these attention-seekers. It's an empowering feeling to be so comfortable with yourself (endowed or not) that you are proud to post nude photos. The compliments feel great as well! In this sense, it is not done for attention. After all, most people choose to remain anonymous -so what attention are they really getting?

You're also forgetting the tremendous amount of sexual energy that factors into posting nude photos. People enjoy browsing other's nude photos, so they decide to contribute some of their own. It gives them pleasure to know that other people get pleasure by seeing the posted photos. Again, this is more empowering than attention-seeking.

I agree that people enjoy showing off, in any context, but isn't that stool a form of attention seeking?  Being proud of something (which in the case of nudes, like breast size, is sometimes uncontrollable and not something that one has to work for to attain that pride) is different than showing it off.  I'm proud of my own genitals but I have no need to show them to anyone other than my girlfriend who I want to enjoy them.  The difference I see is between pride and attention seeking behavior caused by pride.  

You so make a good point about the sexual energy.  I completely overlooked this part of the equation.  Of course, for those in relationships or some kind of monogamous partnership, I understand the sexual energy between sharing and receiving sexual images between each other.  In the example of the monogamous partnership, I do not consider that type of behavior as being attention seeking or anything because it is meant to be between the two individuals for their own mutual sexual pleasure.  The difference between that scenario (which I think most people can agree with) and posting nudes online is that often someone will post an image and an unknown amount of people may see it and get pleasure from it.  Nudes end up all over the internet and going into that situation, a nudes-poster should anticipate this.  In anticipating this inevitability, aren't they then giving away they're nudes essentially for anyone to recurve sexual pleasure from?  I see that behavior as attention seeking because what they get in return is the gratification of strangers admitting their nudity without the mutual respect in return.

In regard to your comment anonymity, I don't see it as one wanting to gain some type of status from it attached to themselves, but instead the gratification of having others pleasure themselves to their nudity.  For example, internet trolls work on the basis of causing as much fuss and attention as possible while often remaining anonymous.  They are not trying to get attention toward themselves superficially, but they're instead attention seeking to just get the attention of others.

So you want to show them off to your girlfriend so she will enjoy them. Do you do this to seek attention from her? Or do you do it because it is empowering? It makes you feel good when she tells you how impressed she is with your junk and when she gets pleasure from it. Other people don't have partners to do this with so they resort to the internet. Some people even have partners and still do it. It's a thrill and a risk that gives people immense pleasure.

&gt; In anticipating this inevitability, aren't they then giving away they're nudes essentially for anyone to recurve sexual pleasure from? 

They are not getting any attention though, since they usually remain anonymous. Also, when it is spread online you hardly ever find out who has seen it or what people think of it. Therefore, you may never be able to recognize the attention you get. Just the act of posting the photo is enough to drive some people wild, whether 1 person sees it or 1,000.

I want to show them to my girlfriend because I know that it makes her think of our sexual activities and I'm trying to make her think about that to remind her off how it feels good physically and to be close with her in a sexual way.  I don't do it to bring attention to myself, but rather to our relationship.  This is much different from posting a photo that a tension stranger will masturbate to.

Like I've said, isn't the garnering of any attention on the internet from your nudes photos still seeking the attention of others? It doesn't matter how many strangers see it, just the fact that they are strangers.  I think the anonymity of the internet allows people to freely get the attention without worrying about the recognition or views of friends and family, so they're purposely looking for attention they can't find within their immediate relationships.

You do it because you get pleasure from your girlfriend being into you and your sexual relationship. This is empowering, not attention seeking. Other people do it because they get pleasure from strangers masturbating to it. This is empowering, not attention seeking. Just because you don't find it empowering to post nudes, doesn't mean other people won't. It's impossible to assert that everyone who has posted nudes does it strictly for attention. Similarly, I have sent photos of this nature to various girls who I was not dating. However, I have never posted nudes online. I'm somewhere in between this spectrum. I can guarantee you I was not trying to get attention from these girls, and nor was I trying to make them think of our sexual activities or remind them of sex (impossible since I didn't live near them). I enjoyed their compliments, knowing that they received pleasure, and seeing their photos as well. Sexting is an entirely separate entity that has it's own set of motivations.

I guess a big issue that others here have pointed out is my distinction between empowering and attention seeking.  I just don't understand that you're of behavior and since I have never partaken in it I just can't grasp it.  The trouble I have is that I don't get a good enough perspective from those that do post nudes online.  

You're right about the sexting thing, and that's where, as I stated in another comment, the fine line ice drawn is hard to find and relatively ambiguous.  Of course, I have no issue with sexting, considering I do it often, so I guess in that sense I can sort of understand the stance one would receive from posting nudes.

Just as I don't necessarily understand the joy of exhibitionism, exhibitionists don't understand how I *don't* find joy from it. Since I am so unaccustomed to it and do not partake in it, I can't make an uninformed judgement about it. I am not going to tell that person that he/she is doing it for attention - because frankly - I have no clue why exactly the person does it (the person may not even know either)!

Thats very true.  I guess I just doubt understand.  Of course, I don't share these opinions with others, I'm just saying that it's hard to get over these opinions I have.

You've definitely helped me see this from other angles.  Applying it to my own life and what I personally do is a good way to assess not only this situation, but any situation in general.  Thank you.

I think this is how I award you a delta?  Δ
