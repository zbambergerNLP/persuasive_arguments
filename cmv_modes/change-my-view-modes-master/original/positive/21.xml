<title>CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...</title>

The options are as follows:

1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it.

2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure. 

3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it.


Reasoning: I used to follow 'option number 3', but recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values. I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however, so feel free to prove me wrong.

I think restricting this concept to the meat industry limits us to a "vegetarian/vegan lifestyle vs. carnivore lifestyle" debate, when it's actually a lot deeper than that.

I know, for instance, that components in my smartphone and laptop are made of minerals that were mined by slave labor in Africa.  I know that the chocolates I love to eat contain, in all likelihood, cacao that was farmed by people living in truly deplorable conditions.  I know that the medication I take was almost certainly tested on research animals who lived short, sad lives.  I know that there's a good chance that the shirt I'm wearing was produced by underpaid, overworked labors who might have even been children.  I know that the salad I'm planning to eat for lunch contains ingredients that were probably farmed in environmentally destructive ways that contribute to climate change.  I know that my leftover Christmas cookies, made by my vegetarian mother, still contain eggs that probably came from a battery farm.  I know that by purchasing my knockoff Keurig coffee from Wal-Mart, I'm supporting a corporation that exploits everything it touches.

And that't the ethical weight of just the things that are in arm's reach of me!  Aren't we all choosing Option 3 for most of the ethical conflicts in our lives?  I think people quickly reach a point of ethical fatigue where they simply *can't* care anymore.  A completely ethical lifestyle is probably not possible without completely rejecting the modern world.  That doesn't mean I can't try to *reduce* my impact on the world... but I have to accept that I will *never* be able to fully live within my own values.

I see what you're getting at. It's easier to forget and ignore because there's too much injustice in the world if you tally it all up. I'd still consider what you described as being the third option on my original post, but it's a very detailed version of it that explains it well.

&gt;That doesn't mean I can't try to reduce my impact on the world... but I have to accept that I will never be able to fully live within my own values.

This would also be my reasoning if I were vegan but still wouldn't take a flight out to help build a school in Africa. It would also make sense if I was building a school in African but wasn't vegan. 
If I was doing absolutely nothing to aid any of the values I believe in, then it wouldn't make any sense however.

Yeah, I think there's just a limited number of things that people are capable of caring about at one time, and issues that are of personal relevance are always going to carry more weight.  So while someone might take Option 1 on a personally significant issue that has a lot of meaning to them, the limitations of the human mind force them to take Option 3 on a whole lot of other issues.  So somebody who takes Option 3 on a particular issue may not be making a true choice to *ignore* that issue.  They're just prioritizing their mental resources.  Without prioritizing those resources, there's a risk of "compassion fatigue," which you see frequently among people in empathy-intensive occupations (especially medicine, education, and other fields where issues outside the individual's control tend to produce strong feelings of frustration and futility).

I do care about the welfare of food animals, and I do think that there are ways to produce meat in ways that are at least more humane if not more "ethical."  I support these efforts when they're available.  But I also think that the welfare of food animals is part of a much larger constellation of interrelated "food production issues" that involve everything from environmental impacts to worker safety to the corporatization of agriculture to government subsidies, and that without some major changes to those other "food production issues" then there probably won't be significant improvement in animal welfare.  So to that end, it's good that people have different Option 1 priorities to attack the problems from multiple sides.

Thank you, whilst my original view still stands, you've altered it in such a way that I now feel a little able to understand others better and in a less scornful light at least!
