<title>CMV: Any given aspect of the legal system should be short and simple enough that an average high school graduate could fully memorize it</title>

CLARIFICATIONS BASED ON ANTICIPATED CONFUSION: 

(1.) I'm **not** saying simple enough that **all** high school students **should** memorize them; I'm saying simple enough that almost anyone could, if they were struck by the impulse to make that unusually large commitment, do so. Like, most people don't memorize all of Romeo and Juliet. But most people, I think, if they really wanted to, **could.**

(2.) I'm not interested in hearing any arguments that are based in any way on what the laws are, right now, except by way of comparison. This includes the constitution. Seriously -- this isn't what I want to argue here, but I'm 100% on board with trashing the US constitution and starting from scratch with new documents, so appealing to the constitution is not on topic.

I'm not a fan of extreme simplification, but I think the American legal system has gotten out of hand in complexity. I think the law should be simple enough that close to anybody could reasonably know the mechanics of all the laws likely to apply to them.

Ideally, it should be a relatively simple feat of memorization to learn the names of all the categories of law; the number of laws in each category; and the basic mechanics of the enforcement of that category's laws.

By categories, I mean things like: criminal law; the tax code; any given category of regulation by profession (medical, construction, IT, and so on). 

I'd be fine with memorizing all the laws being a feat on par with memorizing the Bible; but it should be well within the average citizen's capacity to know all the laws likely to apply to them, word-for-word or close to it.

Edit 9:55: CLARIFICATIONS BASED ON CONFUSION THAT HAS OCCURRED:

(1.) I am not arguing that a shorter legal code is by definition easy to understand. I am not arguing that the average High School student should be able to achieve a lawyer's level of expertise in any given aspect. I'm defending the memorization criterion as a way to limit the total length and vagueness of a set of laws.

EDIT 8:35 the following morning: Nobody last night since I went to bed made any points that I haven't already addressed more than once, so I'm done individually responding unless somebody comes up with something new. For the answers to all the posts since I went to bed: see anticipated clarifications 1 and 2, clarification based on actual confusion 1, [this comment,](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2qrlmm/cmv_any_given_aspect_of_the_legal_system_should/cn91esr) and literally the name of the subreddit.

many laws regulate things that are simply far too complex to simplify to that level. It generally takes an undergraduate college level education at minimum to understand something like international financial markets and to then effectively regulate them. Laws have to be made with a working knowledge of the system and their language will reflect that.

2nd reply: I will grant that changing the US laws would not change international laws, and the systems of treaties necessary to interface with other countries' economies would be complex in proportion to the complexities of those countries' economic law. So, you get a delta for that point. ∆ I do think that the actual practice of economics would become drastically simpler if the law were simpler internationally (in ways that I respect would still be complicated) but I agree with the point you didn't necessarily actually make that reforming all the countries' economic legal systems to be simpler in compatible ways at the same time is a way bigger implausibility than reforming just one country's economic law in a way that is self-consistent.
