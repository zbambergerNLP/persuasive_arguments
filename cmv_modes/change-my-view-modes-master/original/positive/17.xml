<title>CMV: Driving a car is insanely risky and probably the most dangerous thing you do in your everyday life.</title>

I find it difficult to understand how so many people enjoy driving a car or can even relax while doing it. I am almost continually tense while on the road thinking about what's at stake (and I've been driving for almost 20 years).

While I have never been in an accident, I often find myself thinking how dangerous even small motions of a driver can be. For example, a sudden small jerking movement of an arm on the steering wheel leading the car into oncoming traffic can lead to almost certain instant death. I cannot think of any other action in my daily life where so many small actions (of me or other people) can be lethal.

Even leaving accidents and catastrophic scenarios out of consideration, driving a car seems extremely risky to me: For many, maybe most people their car is the most expensive single item that they own. Even small mistakes like a lack of concentration or a tiny miscalculation while parking into a small space, can lead to high damage and expensive repairs.

There is a way to measure risk, called a micromort. It's a unit of risk representing a one in a million chance to die. To accumulate a micromort in a car, you have to travel 230 miles. To accumulate a micromort on a motorcycle, you have to travel 6 miles. On a bicycle, you would have to travel 20 miles, and just walking, you would have to travel 17 miles. 

In a car, I average about 32 mph, so for me, it would take 7 hours of driving to get a micromort. On a motorcycle, it would take about 10 minutes. It would take me 3-4 hours on a bicycle, and about 6 hours walking. So, for me, riding a motorcycle, bicycle, or walking would be more dangerous than driving (or being a passenger) in a car.

&amp;#8710; TBH, the fact that by this metric walking is more dangerous than driving blows my mind. I guess that it depends on where you walk? (Then again, the same is certainly true for driving.)

Maybe I feel more in control when walking, so I underestimate its dangers? It seems that you have made an excellent point here.
