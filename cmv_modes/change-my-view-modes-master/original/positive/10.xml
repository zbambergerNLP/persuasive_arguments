In the last few weeks we've had two huge events happen in the world, both of which were caused by matters relating to "freedom of speech." The first being the hacking of Sony over The Interview, and today the shooting at the offices of a satirical magazine in Paris. I certainly value our free speech but to me there is a clear line between exercising your first amendment right ("President Obama sucks!" etc) and doing things that are known to be offensive to other cultures (Satirical cartoons of prophets, assassinating leaders, etc).

Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.

Think of something you do every day that you consider perfectly reasonable; something that harms nobody in any direct sense.  Let's imagine this thing is to defined as "walking down the street wearing headphones".

Now imagine that I tell you that you doing this offends me deeply for reasons of personal belief that you don't share.  I warn you that continuing to do this will mean that I will shoot you on sight.

In a society that can't protect you from me, it might be *wise* for you to take off your headphones to preserve your life.  That does not make my demand legitimate, does not make my shooting you an acceptable act and does not make my actions your fault.  What you ought to hope is that society will protect you from someone like me and make it clear to me that my preferences will not be especially entertained because I threaten violence.

I think people who satirize Muhammad in ways that Muslims consider blasphemous should stop doing that.  I think it's counterproductive, antagonizing and in poor taste.   But if someone disagrees with me on that point, *they don't deserve to be shot.*

I definitely do condone any sort of reactionary violence and hope I didn't imply that through my post. What would the reaction from Americans be if someone walked through the streets of a predominantly black neighborhood saying "I hate black people" and was murdered? I guarantee no one would care. But suddenly everyone was up in arms when they thought they were never going to see the movie The Interview because for a few moments Sony reevaluated the situation and decided not to release it. Nobody seemed to be saying "Jeez guys, maybe this is a really bad idea and we shouldn't do it." Most people seemed to be saying "Fuck North Korea!! We'll watch our fucking movie cause we'ere FREE in America!!"

"What would the likely reaction be?" is not the right question to ask.  You should ask "what is the proper reaction?" A person doing that is probably an asshole, but that does not mean that silencing him is a proper reaction.  And I think many people would care, because nothing you say should be enough to justify my shooting you.

The two examples you've mentioned are both examples of satire that have been forcibly silenced.  Satire is the portion of speech that always stretches the boundaries of what we condone because its purpose is often to be offensive as a means of highlighting truths about people or society that are difficult to address seriously.

In any case, I think you may have missed the point.  None of the examples you given actually hurt anybody.  They have only provoked reactions.  North Korea hacked Sony because they are so paranoid and insecure that they can't stand their leader being mocked.  Some Muslims are so irrationally offended and self-important that they believe they have both the imperative and the right to kill people for drawing pictures.  Neither of these examples illustrate problems with the speakers, they show the unhinged reactions of listeners.

Damn. I think you just changed my view. That's what I needed, thank you. ∆
