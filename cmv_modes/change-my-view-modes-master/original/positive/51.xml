<title>CMV: I don't think anyone should have to pay child support. Ever.</title>

My logic basically stems from the idea of "If you can't afford to have child, you can't have a child." Let me explain.

In my opinion, if one parent wants to keep the child and the other doesn't, then unless they can be proven unfit for parenting -this includes financial instability- then good for them, go for it. The only time I could see child support being necessary is if they parent needs the extra money to support their child(ren). But I'm sorry, you can't have a child if you can't support it and you sure as hell can't take the money from someone else regardless of their involvement in the child's creation. 

Obviously it's a different story if they are splitting custody, then an arrangement should be made about how the money should be split.

If only the mother wants the child then she can have it and raise it by herself or with whomever she wants.

If only the father wants the child then it's up to the mother if she wants to have it and the forfeit custody to him after birth. If she does then it's the father's responsibility alone. No strings attached.

I realize that it's to stop guys from knocking up women and then running off and leaving her to raise it but she can just get an abortion if she can't raise it. Or put it up for adoption/ find a willing guardian (ex.: friend, parent etc.) if she doesn't want to do that. Not to mention the fact that both of them should have taken precautions to avoid pregnancy beforehand, though I admit nothing's fool proof.

Anyway, I haven't been thinking about this very long so I could be completely missing something so CMV.

Edit: Whoa this is controversial. Thanks everyone for commenting.
A few people pointed out that if the parents are already together and one tries to walk out they should still have to pay. Yes, I agree because there was an understanding that both would provide for the kid. I'm talking about right after the pregnancy or even right after birth. If one person wants to keep it and the other doesn't, that's their decision and they need to pay for it.

Mkay. View changed thnx guis. &amp;#8710;. No but I guess it makes sense to hold both parties accountable if they understood the risks in the first place, which everybody does. I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea, but they sort of agreed to the risks when they consented.

But a lot of fathers run off after already being in a child's life for a period of years.  Unplanned or planned, sometimes a couple raises a kid together and then one parent wants out.  At that point you're past the "if you want to keep it" phase.

Hmm. I didn't think about that. Maybe once the decision is made, you have to follow through with it. Like a contract. If one parent wants out then I suppose they both still need to pay for it even if one doesn't stay in contact with the child. Simply because that was what was agreed upon and the other was not prepared for that to happen.

More of an exception than a view change but I'll give it to you anyway. Thanks.
