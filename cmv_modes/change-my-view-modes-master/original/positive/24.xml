Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.

&gt;There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future?
&gt;
It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man.
&gt;
The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species.

There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlQrYCacrKo&amp;spfreload=10

I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself.

I do disagree with Gade a little bit. I don't think it would kill everybody, but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes. I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much.

How exactly are we dying here? I mean if we mass produce food production that just means there is more food than there was before. 


I mean, not looking at if your economics are good or not, but how does everyone die off? Starve to death?  There is more food now than has been produced ever, at any time. 

  There is no way that we would ever go back to hunting and gathering. We would go back to farming if we had to back to anything at all. 

People write stuff like the places you have gotten some of your ideas because people pay good money to hear something that confirms their fears. Things will happen. The world will adapt. This is been how the world has reacted to things for centuries.

Yeah, going back to farming makes more sense then going back to hunting and gathering. 

The infrastructure isn't just going to walk away just because the economy collapsed and someone is going to want to keep it maintained, that is why so many Roman buildings still exist. Hydroponics could be done by anyone with electricity and a basement âˆ†.
