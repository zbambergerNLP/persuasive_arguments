I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not "blaming" the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a "worthwhile endeavor" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and "explaining causation" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as "part 1" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term "causation" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that "avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that "explaining causation is not victim blaming", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think "explaining causation" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

Rapists are rapists. Thieves are thieves. What works for a single individual doesn't work when done by everyone. 

You tell women, "don't wear bear midriffs. Our study shows that people wearing bare midriffs are more likely to get raped." Everyone follows your advice and stops wearing bear midriffs. Five years later, you look at the data, "hmm, it seems that now people who have bare shoulders and short shorts are being raped more than those wearing longer skirts and shirts covering their shoulders. Stop wearing these to decrease your chance of being raped." Everyone does. Now no women ever bare their shoulders, spaghetti straps are gone, and shirts and skirts always at least go to the ankles. Then you do a study and find that women wearing short sleeves are more likely to be raped... Fast forward a few years, and you're advising women on the width of their burqa eye slot in order to decrease the chance of being raped. 

Ok, so how about traveling? Well, you tell women not to walk alone on dark streets at night. Rapists are apparently targeting these, the most vulnerable women. So all women start traveling on well-lit streets. Then rapists target them on the well-lit streets, and you tell them to stop traveling alone. They start only traveling in packs, and rapists start attacking in gangs. Before you know it, you're saying, "of course she got raped. What did she expect going out in public without her father, brother, or husband escorting her?"

Same thing with thieves. You can say, "well of course you got robbed, you left your door unlocked." When everyone locks their doors, your message changes to, "well of course you got robbed, you didn't reinforce the door frame with a door armor kit." When everyone does that, it becomes, "of course they broke through the window, why do you live in a place without bullet-proof glass?"

Basically, imagine every potential victim of a crime on a line put in order of easiest to hardest to rob/rape/kill. Violators will simply target those at the lowest end of the curve, regardless of where that is. If everyone follows your helpful advice, the actual number of crimes doesn't decrease. All that happens is that the violators' definition of an "easy victim" changes.

I never prescribed any behavior in my post; most of the point was that understanding what leads to an event doesn't imply that the event was justified or deserved. And I think you'd agree with that. 

Your post assumes an escalation in crime behavior and "daring". Firstly, I never said this would decrease crime. In my personal experience, I've noticed that changing your behavior or taking certain precautions can help avoid certain outcomes; not absolutely, of course, but it helps. As part of your post implies, there will always be crime and unsafe areas. I just don't think your examples are a very realistic chain of events.

Why not? We have countries all over the world with different levels of dress codes and public modesty. There's a continuous spectrum, from countries where it's legal for women to go topless, to countries where we have to wear burqas. In each and every country, there are people saying, "well, she would have been less likely to get raped if she dressed more modestly."

Hmm. I do realize that. But if that's the case, your argument seems to be that taking these precautions on a systemic level actually causes these compounding situations, no? That's at least what your initial post implies.

Exactly. That's the problem with giving such "risk avoidance" advice when it comes to crime. The root cause of the crime is still the criminal. In a society where everyone follows your risk avoidance advice, the criminals just change targets.
