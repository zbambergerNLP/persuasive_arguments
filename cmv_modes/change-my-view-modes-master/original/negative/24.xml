I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not "blaming" the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a "worthwhile endeavor" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and "explaining causation" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as "part 1" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term "causation" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that "avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that "explaining causation is not victim blaming", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think "explaining causation" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

You are calling something causation when, at best, it was something that had a minor contribution to the cause. Dressing scantily does not cause rape, a rapist causes rape. Not locking your house does not cause a burglary, a burglar causes a burglary. Not staying in at night does not cause a mugging, a mugger causes the mugging.

These are things you ought to be able to do; dress sexy, leave your house unlocked, and travel when it's dark. Just because one thing is correlated with another, doesn't mean one thing *caused* the other. The full blame, and the *only* cause, lies with the perpetrator. 

If some is in a store, and a car crashes though the window and kills them; did they cause it? Surely, if they weren't in the store they would still be alive. It is known that cars sometimes crash into and through buildings, so they could have avoided it. You can play the game of circumstances until you can't do *anything* without being at fault.

"These are things you ought to be able to do".

Of course this is correct; I specifically said something along those lines in the original statement. We ought to work towards a world in which this is the case. However, our world is not currently like this, unfortunately. As u/gomboloid says above, a productive discussion can result from saying something like: "I got mugged at this part of town, maybe you should avoid going there at this time of night". Of course the mugger causes the mugging; but if changing your behavior in a certain way reduces the chance of getting mugged, why not do it? 

You dismiss it as a "minor contribution" to the cause. But if there are certain precautions one might take in order to protect themselves, why not take them?

Yes, the "full blame" lies with the perpetrator. Like I said, this isn't a question of justification. This is a touchy issue, and people are often unable to think about these things in a rational way because they're afraid of implying some sort of justification. My first view is "explaining causation does not imply justification". Throughout your response, you continually use "blame" language: "at fault", "full blame", etc., when I never placed any blame on the victim. 

"You can play the game of circumstances until you can't do anything without being at fault."
Let's be realistic here. There are certain legitimate circumstances that are more dangerous. So if you avoid putting yourself in them, you might avoid danger. That doesn't mean you "deserve" a bad outcome if you do put yourself in those situations.

You can take measures to reduce your risk, but failure to reduce risk is not causing something to happen. At what point have you sufficiently reduced risk to remove your causal contribution? Let's take a fatal car accident (other driver at fault):

* Is wearing a seatbelt enough?
* Driving a big, heavy car?
* Only driving on empty streets?

Is the only way to prevent "causing" your fatal accident to not drive at all? It's easy to point to the things you are willing to avoid, and say others ought not have done them. If you work downtown and don't get off until late, is it reasonable to have them stay overnight in the office? Is the fact that they have that job the reason they got mugged?

&gt; You dismiss it as a "minor contribution" to the cause. But if there are certain precautions one might take in order to protect themselves, why not take them?

How many precautions are enough? It's reasonable to take the precaution of not going on message boards and talking about rape fantasies. Is it reasonable to cover up as if you were in the middle east just so a man won't rape you? That is the justification for how the women dress; it's that their dress evokes urges in men.

&gt; Throughout your response, you continually use "blame" language: "at fault", "full blame", etc., when I never placed any blame on the victim.

I'm not sure you can separate cause and blame. Your sentiment is essentially "if you hadn't been doing x, then y would not have happened". You can dress it up by saying it's cause and not blame, but it is blame.

&gt; Let's be realistic here. There are certain legitimate circumstances that are more dangerous. So if you avoid putting yourself in them, you might avoid danger. That doesn't mean you "deserve" a bad outcome if you do put yourself in those situations.

Wearing a revealing outfit is a dangerous activity? The vast majority of women wearing revealing outfits are not raped, yet, that is trotted out when a women in a revealing outfit happens to be raped. If they aren't wearing a revealing outfit, we pick another reason (out late at night, at a party, drinking, etc). The point is people do these things safely the overwhelming majority of the time. The reason they were raped is that circumstances *beyond their control* put them in the wrong place at the wrong time. You can dress conservatively, not drink, not go out, not party, and what life do you have now?

This seems to be a fundamental source of disagreement. I don't see it as "dressing it up" as cause. As I said, "blame" implies a level of justification that "cause" does not. There is a negative connotation around blame. Regarding "cause" - you are correct in an earlier comment that there are many factors that go into an outcome. 

I didn't say wearing a revealing outfit is a dangerous activity. In my examples, I focused much more on things like the parts of a city one chooses to frequent at night. Part of my point is that it hopefully generates a productive discussion by considering all these factors leading to an outcome - it helps you understand that outcome better.

Those "car accident factors" are all, of course, things different people take into consideration. If you crash your car and fly through the windshield and die - because you weren't wearing your seatbelt - then wearing your seatbelt might have saved your life. Even if someone else crashed into you and you had no control over that - you had control over whether to wear a seatbelt.

I'm not saying people OUGHT to wear a seatbelt. I wear a seatbelt. I'm not prescribing behavior. This is intended to be a very general discussion about the types of conversations people have and which ones are rejected on certain grounds.
