<title>CMV: Irony aside, most people that post in CMV are uneducated, and changing their view on one point won't solve this overall problem</title>

<OP author="1millionbucks">
There are some instances, yes where controversial topics are discussed here and people are actually interested in hearing the opposite side. I consider myself one of those people, and was initially driven to this subreddit in the hope that I would meet other people like myself that were posting here to educate themselves. The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.

But far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday's [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.

And the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.

Additionally, the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already, even before submitting. Go ahead, think of something you believe that is controversial and click "Submit CMV." Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this: it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.

Thanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post, albeit maybe not today, and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.

Quick edit: I realized I didn't address the second part of my title claim. Albert Einstein said that 2 things are limitless: the universe and human stupidity. For every stupid person that posts on this sub to address one point of their lack of knowledge, there are foreseeably dozens more points of misunderstanding that remain. What is the overall aim of this subreddit? To educate one at a time, indeed. But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed. This is a real debate: anything else is just convincing a stupid person of something that they fail to understand.

People naturally have an aversion to being wrong about things. That's just the way it is. We have that to work with and we can't really change it. 

I think the issue isn't that people are uneducated, but that they are unwilling to hear alternative views, which is what you seem to be saying, but your title suggests otherwise.  

If that's all your getting at, there's not much debate other than *to what extent* this occurs. You stated *most*, so you're asserting more than 50%. Have you done any type of study to see how many OPs change their view?

No, I have no studies to back up the "most" besides my personal analysis of the posts that arise.

I agree also that unwilling might be a better word than uneducated.

Well this is part of the problem. People post things that can't be actual investigated with current knowledge. Your claim needs data to support it.  The most damning thing about your claim is that someone not changing their mind doesn't necessarily mean they were unwilling to do so. It might just be that they are unconvinced.

<reply id="cngr5kw" author="1millionbucks">
That is not necessarily true. As I've said elsewhere, many people post about things that are not controversial and can be answered with a simple Google post. Since these types of posts, in my experience, constitute the majority of traffic through the sub, the OPs of these posts are in some way opposed to the alternative view of their topic.

Example?

<reply id="cngrpzv" author="1millionbucks">
In the example I used in the main body of the post, the atheism thread, there are several valid, scientifically accepted reasons as to why religion exists. I asked the OP: is it a coincidence that religions formed in each and every society across the globe, without any contact? This is evidence that the idea behind religion is embedded in human nature, which is an accepted statement that is validated by psychoanalysis. Someone posted the same thing as I did, essentially, and this is how the OP replied:

<reply id="cngto2g" author="Kenny__Loggins">
His initial point is that religion is *still* in society because of indoctrination. Not that out started that way. It's a valid hypothesis.  Atheism is on the rise. I know for certain that many people in the bible belt use indoctrination to ensure their children believe what they do. I am one of them, but I am lucky enough to find my way out 

Edit: although, he would also need actual data to make this anything more than a hypothesis.

You really have to read the whole thread to get a grasp of the issue, I'm not going to argue it here. The OP was quite militant in my opinion, and the issues were discussed deeply enough that he should have rolled around to the correct conclusion, that is, that God is embedded in human nature. Instead, he used his original post as a medium for a god/athiesm debate.

<reply id="cnguss5" author="Kenny__Loggins">
I don't think the idea that "God is embedded in human nature" is well founded. More so,  humans are uncomfortable not knowing so they make up answers.

Well you are free to think that, but you're going to be arguing against established psychoanalytic theory. Feel free to submit your research paper to the proper committee when you've established your reasoning.

Not to be rude, but it's frustrating.
