<title>CMV: Irony aside, most people that post in CMV are uneducated, and changing their view on one point won't solve this overall problem</title>

There are some instances, yes where controversial topics are discussed here and people are actually interested in hearing the opposite side. I consider myself one of those people, and was initially driven to this subreddit in the hope that I would meet other people like myself that were posting here to educate themselves. The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.

But far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday's [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.

And the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.

Additionally, the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already, even before submitting. Go ahead, think of something you believe that is controversial and click "Submit CMV." Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this: it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.

Thanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post, albeit maybe not today, and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.

Quick edit: I realized I didn't address the second part of my title claim. Albert Einstein said that 2 things are limitless: the universe and human stupidity. For every stupid person that posts on this sub to address one point of their lack of knowledge, there are foreseeably dozens more points of misunderstanding that remain. What is the overall aim of this subreddit? To educate one at a time, indeed. But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed. This is a real debate: anything else is just convincing a stupid person of something that they fail to understand.

Assuming the poster had the skill to Google what he was looking for in the first place (some don't), there's one problem - they need to make a huge effort to *continue* googling. It's all too easy to find one or two links which provide either neutral or positive points to your opinion. It's also too easy to cherrypick your searches *just* to include those points, or to do other mental gymnastics to avoid the fact that they may be wrong. If nobody is watching, it's surprisingly easy to say "no, I don't believe that." and dismiss it without formulating an argument against it.

But a CMV is different, it's an arena. OP has no control over the data given to him, and it's very curated data with ELI5-style text around it. There's no search term fudging, not nearly so much ability to dismiss data that disagrees, and the points being made might be things that you hadn't thought to google at all. But best of all, it's made out directly to OP. These people are challenging an OP directly, not just passively throwing links around. It's a hugely different mindset than combing through search results.

&gt;it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.

I disagree. I find that most people have completely changed their minds on most all issues over time. But the key is that it's not like a boxing match; nobody made a knock-out argument that forced their opponent to sit in stunned silence until they admit they're wrong. Instead, most opinions are changed by being seeded by doubt - doubt that grows and becomes very uncomfortable until the person finds themselves arguing in favor of that doubt ( and against their original view). There's no moment in which a person's mind is changed, it's a process. A journey. And the seeds of that doubt could very easily come from a CMV.

I agree with you that being open-minded is difficult. It takes constant vigilance. But It's not binary, it's a continuum. It may take someone all their life to change their view, but it still happens.
