Okay, I'm talking about making the human race smarter, forever.
Intelligence is at least partially genetic and therefore passed down by parents, yes? [Yes.](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40459/title/Inherited-Intelligence/)

So, what if, instead of killing off the less-intelligent people (I'm against killing. Of most things.) we just limit offspring?

For example, we could use the IQ scale (for want of a better intelligence measure) to determine the number of offspring a person should be able to genetically contribute to.
Like, round the IQ to the nearest multiple of 50, then divide by 50, and that's the number of offspring you're allowed to create.

So someone with near average intelligence (near 100 IQ, 75-124) would have their IQ rounded to 100 and then divided by 50 to make 2 offspring. 
The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it. A man and a woman with average IQ can have two children (not each.) and sustain their population.

Conversely, really above average IQs of 125-174 can contribute genetically towards 3 children... and so on.

This would eventually make the human race smarter, and therefore more likely to survive and advance the human race. 

I know this would be a bitch to implement and it's near impossible to actually do, but I'm just looking at the concept. I know the IQ test has its faults and every policy can be abused... I know all that.

Exceptions would be made when you accidentally have twins which causes you to go over your limit, or etc. (If a mother can make 2, and has twins, she can't make more, but if she already has one and has twins after one which makes 3, we're not gonna kill one)

Perhaps if you have a major, heritable health issue your IQ has 25 subtracted from it before being rounded? Or maybe weighted differently, like extremely high chance of cancer (almost 100 percent or something) takes off more... Something like that.

Much better than "Kill off those with IQ less than 80"

I wouldn't mind a smarter human race...

EDIT: **I am trying to argue that this process, if not abused, if followed by the people, and if we found an increasingly accurate measure of intelligence, would be ultimately a good thing to advance the human race.**

EDIT 2: "**It looks to me like you've made so many exceptions to your main view that you aren't looking to have your view changed. I'd like to talk about the title of your post, but if you have to make so many exceptions to your view, then it seems you already know it's incorrect.**" -nikeson
I suppose that's true, now....

Hey!  This is one of my great ideas that's so crazy it'll never even be discussed.  Seriously, you want to tell americans they have limits on how many kids they can have?  The conservatives will make parallels to China, and the religious will make it they're goal to create an army in retaliation and out of fear.  Hell, they're doing that now without being threatened.  That being said ...

I wouldn't use IQ, it just sucks ... it could also be detrimental.  I think we all know lots of really smart people who are fairly useless, and other dumb people who accomplish all kinds of stuff and are super successful.  The goal should be to create a better society, not just one aspect like intelligence.  So we shouldn't reward intelligence, per se, but ambition and education.  So here's my idea.

Each person is allowed one child.  So every married couple can have two kids.  It's not directly attached to the person though, kind of like a ticket to get cashed in.  So you can sell your ticket if you don't want to have children, or want money for ... whatever.  This obviously benefits the wealthy.  It's supposed to because if a person has more resources they are better suited to take care of more children, financially.  It could also become a thing where kids sell away their reproductive rights and travel, or use it to pay for education, only to do the same with their disposable income when they get older, allowing the next generation to have some disposable income when they have the time and energy to use it.

The second part is education.  If you graduate college, or a trade school (note that these would have to be properly defined with criteria, so that diploma mills aren't equivalent to real universities), but achieving a higher degree of education or a advanced knowledge of a craft provides you with the ability to earn a better living, and therefore have additional children if you so desire.  Not to mention the major point of this is to make the world a better place, and the more people in your society that have advanced training leads towards a better society.  So obtaining a degree of higher learning would earn you an additional 'ticket'.  Doctoral graduates would be another.

This creates an interesting dynamic in the society, as those who are permitted to have children won't always have the time to properly raise them, as they have careers and such.  A nearly complete overhaul of our culture would have to take place for this to have a positive result.  We'd have to take a 'it takes a village to raise a child' approach and establish a government provided child care service group to establish programming, employee requirements, pay, increase in taxes, oversight, etc.  This would be combined with an overhaul of the education system to create programs that teach kids things, instead of just testing them constantly.  This is pretty much where the idea falls apart, since this would require a 180 degree priority change of our government from military to education.  Since education is almost entirely funded and run by the states right now ... well, we all know what happens when you try to take a right away from the states.

The third part is a necessity and the final nail in the coffin as to why nothing like this will happen in my lifetime; mandatory birth control.  It would have to be for either all women not currently trying to get pregnant, or everyone.  (It won't work with guys only because of rape and other sexual crimes.  There's already an issue with girls since they all hit puberty at different times, and birth control for a 13 year old might not be good for her, medically)  This is where my idea completely collapses and where I stopped thinking about it.  When does someone get to have their child?  So now the government tells you when you're ready to be a parent?  What happens to the 1% of the times that the birth control doesn't work?  Even if it's less than 1%, birth control isn't perfect, so it's going to happen.  And it gets worse when you try to figure out how to even execute this plan ... we can't reach everyone now-a-days to give away free condoms and clean needles, you want to get these people into a real clinc, to have a real procedure, that the probably don't' even want?  And then we have immigrants, legal and illegal.  What about refuges, like we're seeing now, what do we do with them?  I mean, this is a heavy regulation ... and the world is a fluid, war torn place.

Like I said, this is where things collapsed.  A barrage of other problems arise, to me it proved that until we have a government system that actually works with the people's best interests in mind, this sort of thing would only make things worse.  Mainly because it gives additional power and control to people who shouldn't have it, and they'll do what they do best, manipulate people with speeches for their benefit.  What are the reasons behind this?  What about other genetic flaws?  Auto-immune diseases, Cancers, heart disease ... hell even bad eyesight is genetic.  If an argument is made that raising the average intelligence of the populace would be beneficial, so much that we can institute regulations on your ability to reproduce (considered by most to be a basic human right), then I can make an equally powerful argument against most any genetic trait.  As long as I can show one trait, or attribute is better than the other; then the topic gets pushed into a grey area and a person's individual priorities and opinions would have a heavy influence on their views.  Imagine trying to have this conversation with a christian zealot who wants to kill all non-baptists, because they're all going to hell and it's our duty to fix god's world by eliminating this genetic flaw.  (I know it's not genetic, but you'll never convince them of that)

The better path currently is a worldwide emphasis on education, skepticism and rational thinking.  Some people are dumb, and some people are smart ... but 90% of the world can learn.  An educated populace who's goal is to make a better world, instead of protect what's mine, would probably solve a shit ton of problems in the world over 2-3 generations.  However, solving the problems means distributing power, and those in charge like the current imbalance so they fight against their citizens having knowledge and the ability to communicate.  The extreme ends are the Nordic countries where access to the internet, education, and proper health care is considered a basic human right ... and North Korea, which is basically a country sized prison.  Those in charge have to be willing to give up some of their power for the betterment of the people, the country and the world.  Even in the US we saw the 'No child left behind' legislation pass.  Although this is a simplistic view of the bill, the result seems to have made the entire country less educated.  By making sure no child was left behind, we slowed down the entire class to the learning capabilities of the dumbest kid (or the kid who simply doesn't care).  So instead of the genius kid building a model rocket from pop bottle in 8th grade, they're reviewing basic arithmetic ... again.
