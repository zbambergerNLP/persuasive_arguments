For those of you who don’t know, it’s common (at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service.

It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers and that such discounts should be given to them.

As for the “They’re not risking their lives for our country.” argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests. Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help, but that’s [usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate.

I’m really hoping there’s a good reason behind the status quo, but we’ll see. [It looks like there’s even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually.]

[[My view’s been changed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rexe3/cmv_emts_sar_firefighters_police_etc_should/cnfj9cu?context=10000) In summary, I think that EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category), but I now believe - for the same reason - that these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all.]

You haven't really participated in this thread, but I'd like to point out federal vs. municipal difference when it comes to location of the discount. 

A coffee shop in Seattle might very well decide to have a local firefighters discount, (I can name a few that do.) But should they honor a vacationing firefighter from Omaha? How can he prove he's a firefighter? Why should a Seattlite care that a man's employed by a city in Nebraska? 

While states may have local branches of National Guard, active duty military members serve the nation as a whole and carry one (1) form of identification that is accepted *everywhere.* 

This simplifies the discount process and may point to a succinct reason why they tend to receive a blanket discount in most areas of the US.

That’s a good point, though I’m curious as to why they don’t advertise the other discounts.

Admittedly, it's not as common as the military discount, but the places that have it advertise the hell out of it.
