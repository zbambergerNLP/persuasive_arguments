<title>CMV: America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had</title>
<source>http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rd7mg/cmv_america_is_a_better_place_because_of_the_55/</source>
<OP author="runescapethug">
<argument> There have been 55 million abortions in the US since 1973 </argument>.    
                 
<argument> Something in the ballpark of 45% of women who have abortions have more than one abortion </argument>.
              
<claim> These people would have been raised by their incompetent parents to drain down society, increase crime rates, suck up resources, and generally screw things up </claim>.   
           
<claim> Various ways to lower a resource negative population would have to be explored, if not because of this 55 million, then because of the next 55 million </claim>.                        
<claim> One possibility is that there would be wars waged to try to kill them all, perhaps even with other countries with similar problems </claim>. <argument> Waging war to purposefully lower population, even with a country facing similar issues, would cost not only resources, but it would also cause political, cultural, and global issues  </argument>.
            
<argument> America's innovation and education rankings would be lower </argument>. <argument> Every middle-class child in the country would receive a lower quality education if there were 55 million more around  </argument>.
                        
(**Note:**I'm not trying to hear arguments on the ethics of abortion, its a banal argument that everyone and their mother has had at one point, what I am really fishing for is insight into what the country would look like with those 55 million around. Would we adapt to the population and make good use of each of them?)         
               
**Was view changed?**  
  <claim> Its a complicated issue </claim>. <argument> Without the extra population from abortions, has there been proportionately more immigration to fill labor needs, or are the millions of illegals from Mexico as likely to be so numerous even if there was a higher none-abortion population </argument> <argument> Doesn't immigration of a working class citizen on such a massive scale cause dissonance in a country more so than it does cultural exchange </argument> , meaning that <claim> it would have been preferable to have our abortions alive </claim>? <argument> Or are we talking about a population so huge that race and national identity are insignificant, that there is always going to be a huge amount of hostility between different demographics </argument>?          -(choppy writing, but i'm on 3 hours of sleep and stretched for time, give me a break)-   
        
                 
(Side thought: <claim> Perhaps the immigration of illegals is lowering the value of blue collar work and makes it harder for the borderline impoverished citizens to provide for their children </claim>. <claim> Its debatable how many women are having abortions due to financial reasons </claim>, but <argument> surely its a significant number </argument>, so <argument> how many of these women wouldn't be having financial troubles if there wasn't competition from cheap illegal labor to keep wages lower </argument>? <claim> This holds true even if illegal immigration is an overall plus to the countries value </claim>. Conclusion: <claim> Mexicans are the supreme race, native Americans will go extinct through abortion and then out-breeding </claim> *no that isn't a serious sentiment, i'm just saying, <claim> this discussion is abstract enough to go into some weird places and that it is necessary to have a stopping point* </claim> )    
                          
Then there is the next question. <claim> Is a more highly populated and economically productive America today going to result in an America tomorrow that can handle over population problems </claim>, or <claim> would having a higher population from none-abortion just add on to the problems of a world going to shit </claim>? Similar: <argument> An aborted fetus is likely to have been a less productive person than a never-considered-for-abortion fetus </argument>, but <claim> in an industrial society, its likely that these abortions would still be more productive than not </claim>.
            
<claim> Then there was the debate as to whether or not a larger population with less resources per person is more innovative than a smaller one </claim>. <claim> This is to be considered if one is convinced that having a higher population coming from none-abortions results in a strain for resources in the country </claim>.  <claim> Modern technology like the internet must be considered </claim>
                 
             
Yes, my view was changed, but not into the polar opposite. I am now confused and lost.                  
           
            
**EDIT:** 
             
I'll be without internet for a few days. I may end up returning and responding more but it won't be anytime soon.   
             
This was my first post to CMV. I apologize for a few things that I did that could be considered *rude* around here. I also see a few times where I got redundant. 
          
Thank you all for your arguments. This is a very critical place, I hope to learn how to better use it and come here more often. I feel I could learn a lot here.

<claim> One thing not calculated in the slightly psychotic weighing of the value of human life as "useful" is the sociological effect of the 55 million just gone </claim>: <argument> A Zeitgeist wherein 55 million abortions is weighed as good for industry or not, the resulting thinking it good on account of efficiency, as certain citizens look on themselves and others as a figure or livestock </argument>. <claim> The attitude of human value as <quote> "what they [potentially] contributed to me/Exxon Mobile" </quote> is the spirit of eugenics and genocide, subjects often glorified on reddit </claim>.

<claim> It's the same problem with war </claim>: <argument> Once killing foreigners is an acceptable/inevitable means to profit and expand, you find that attitudes exposed to such behavior change with it </argument>. <argument> Other countries also build militaries to do so and to "defend" against each other </argument>, and <claim> its no longer viewed as a hostile or paranoid thing to do </claim> because <argument> everybody's doing it and so must do it </argument>. <claim> It becomes a recursive loop and generates a hostile attitude towards foreigners and other countries </claim>.

<claim> This works on the inverse too </claim>. <claim> When we went to the moon, our horizons and view of mankind changed </claim>. <claim> Once we better understood such objects, nature worship definitely changed </claim>. <argument> You'll be hard-pressed to find moon worshipers today </argument>, and <argument> the "religions of the book" may be going out of style as highly literate people have access to more historical data and the time to translate The Bible, Torah, and Quran in context for themselves </argument>. Also, <claim> it was once normal for religions to kill masses of unbelievers </claim>; <argument> now it's seen as wrong, even by the religions themselves </argument>. <claim> The Zeitgeist changes, as people's attitudes adjust to new information and ways of life and problem solving </claim>.

<claim> This Zeitgeist concept is the same problem with the public school </claim>. In it, <claim> intelligence is reduced to reciting what one is told to a high degree of accuracy and memorization </claim>, data treated as "fact" or "fiction" (<claim> in reality, everything is true/untrue depending on it's level of resolution or accuracy </claim>), <argument> children are moved through by age, graded literally on the same scale as a meat product, and bells move them around </argument>. On this, <claim> they're declared intelligent or not, and implicitly worthwhile or not </claim>.

<claim> The many nuances of intelligence, higher forms of intelligence, varieties of people, and bigger issues like antisocial personality disorder and social skills, are virtually ignored during the developmental period for the "efficient" cattle model </claim>. <argument> Good meat or bad meat, instead of people with a variety of skill potential and problems </argument>. <argument> We end up with McEducation literally, with a lot of "product" to be "thrown away" and that seen as okay </argument>; but <claim> the worst thing is not that </claim>, but <argument> the Zeitgeist within society that people should be "grown", and graded, and that these categories are accurate </argument>.  <argument> Consequential attitudes include the idea that information will be bestowed to us like our teachers did </argument>, that <argument> it's "true" or not and that "truth" is available to us in an absolute way </argument>, and <argument> that smart people are cooperative </argument>. <argument> Political parties appeal to these learned biases </argument>. <claim> The general attitude among the adult population is "don't think too much" </claim>, because <argument> it's seen as disruptive, problem-making, and culturally odious, and taking sides on trust is often seen as a good thing </argument>.

So with 55 million abortions, <claim> you're also treated to relaxed attitudes towards eugenics and genocide, and all the warped views of human value and what a "better place" is that come with it </claim>. <argument> Decisions are give-and-take and has benefits as well as problems </argument>. You see, <argument> there would have certainly been benefits to a preemptive tactical nuclear strike against the USSR, and costs too </argument>. <argument> Anybody who denies either is blinded by zeal </argument>, and I'm not saying such a strike would have been worth it, <claim> only that benefits would exist and it's our job to weigh those against the costs always </claim>. <argument> If you cannot see the cost of the 55 million abortions, it means that you should immediately change your view so you can experience the other side of your thinking </argument>, <argument> which has hijacked your perception and mistaken itself for truth recursively </argument>.

<claim> You're mistaking what I believe to be a good outcome as different from what you believe to be a good outcome </claim>.    
              
Think America in 1000 years. <argument> This America faced a sustainable growth rate </argument>. <argument> Imagine this country to be populated by billions of faces </argument>. Pretend that technology has reached such a point that any human can pursue any passion they wish. These Americans can go enjoy the wilderness of a terraformed planet (or use their immortality to wait until that is possible), enter a virtual reality program and experience any event by any person in history as if it was true, go see dinosaurs at the zoo, pursue as many doctorates as they'd like, increase or decrease their intelligence, and never have to work a day of their lives to earn such privileges.   
       
Now imagine America in 200 years. <argument> Babies were created indiscriminately</argument>. <argument> The quality of education regressed and then stagnated to that of the year 1970 </argument>. <argument> Even with new technology, having enough drinking water and arable land is becoming an issue </argument>. <argument> Everything is polluted to hell </argument>. <argument> The wealth gap is a factor of ten worse </argument>. <argument> The perception of the value of human life goes to zero </argument>.
            
(<claim> I am in no way claiming that either one of those imaginary futures would result from having legal/illegal abortion </claim>. <claim> My point is that a responsible today allows for a better future </claim>. My illustrations are ridiculous  )  
                      

         
<claim> Decisions like whether or not the non-existence of 55 million people provides to the greater good have to be faced, such as you said </claim>. 
                  
<claim> Your claim is that the conscious acceptance of deaths providing logistical benefits is damaging to our perception of the value of human life </claim>. 
      
<claim> That is true </claim>, and <claim> such sentiment should be properly weighed by someone attempting to assess whether or not these 55 million abortions have had a positive outcome </claim>. <claim> This should not overtake their thinking and drown out the other considerations </claim>.    
         
<claim> I believe you are in agreement with that. However, <claim> you take the Zeitgeist as pretty much the highest consideration </claim>. This is where we disagree. <argument> I believe in a shittier today for a better tomorrow, such as how our ancestors had miserable and productive lives that ended up with us living to be 80 and fat </argument>
               
<argument> I also don't think that the connection between poor education tactics and the "don't think too much" mentalities can be drawn between the zeitgeist claims you're making </argument>. <argument> If the quality of life is higher, you'll see higher quality education and the available resources for more to be able to think and live as as they'd like </argument>. <argument> If the quality of life is lower, you'll see people working miserable jobs just to be able to eat dinner </argument>, <argument> the only way to avoid depression would be to not think too much </argument>. <argument> Having a low quality of life results in a poor Zeitgeist </argument>.

No, <claim> I was only illustrating a hidden and relatable X-factor to get you to open up within your own assumptions and realize [how many other X-factors might exist,](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2rj2bt/50_of_nigeriens_are_under_14_years_old_in/cngsdvf) and to encourage more caution towards unforeseen consequences and butterfly effects </claim>. <argument> I chose this approach because your view is highly cerebral and overconfident, seemingly unconcerned with potential consequence, and repackaging gross oversimplification and naive callous as bright utilitarianism (no offense) </argument>. <argument> I wanted to offer an example that had to do with people, instead of indulging your quasi-psychotic reasoning </argument>.

<claim> See, psychotic behavior is retarded literally </claim>: <claim> It comes from a lack of emotional sense and is a developmental disorder </claim>. <argument> I'm telling you this because you're probably a teen and will grow out of it by interacting with people like you are </argument>, and <argument> having them challenge you and show disgust </argument>. <argument> Psychotics are developmentally stunted because they're antisocial, even when they're around people </argument>, and so <argument> they never change their view and only develop a 7-year-old view from a little monster into a big monster </argument>. That said, <claim> giving you the socio-political consequences of 55 million people missing might change your view </claim>, but <argument> the stupid and shallow premises would remain untouched </argument>. <claim> You might adjust your facts, but not expand your perspective </claim>.

See, <claim> the reason people are highly sensitive [emotionally] is the same reason you'd turn up the sensitivity dial of a camera, microphone, or any other sensor </claim>: Because <argument> you're concerned you'll miss something, and are aware of the dangers of missing something </argument>. <argument> The mind and emotions operate like extremely complex equipment </argument>. <argument> This is why some people are very squeamish; myself not included </argument>. <argument> Contrarily, when a person is very confident, it's [almost never because they're on a higher tier of information or understanding </argument>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect), but <argument> because they don't even know that they don't know </argument>. <argument> In the case of cold utility, often peddled by teens as very novel because life and the self seems very simple to them, because they've such a low tier of contact with the world that it can look simple from a distance </argument>.

  <argument> It's why we recruit teens into the military </argument>. <argument> They're very easy to trick and convince to shoot a guy in a field for wearing different clothes without asking a lot of questions or thinking too hard about consequences </argument>.

Anyway, that's why I gave that explanation, and <claim> you didn't anticipate it, but thought you did, didn't you </claim>? <claim> You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best </claim>, but <argument> it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style </argument>. <claim> You probably don't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style </claim>. <claim> This is the problem with X-factors and complexity </claim>. <argument> You don't know what you don't know, you didn't know you didn't know my motivation, and you don't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing, or what interests were operating in the establishment of them, or the consequences </argument>. So far, <claim> the consequences are extremely negative for your generation </claim>.

<claim> Teens are still developing, you know </claim>. <argument> There's [plenty of research](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog-extra/the-adolescent-brain-beyond-raging-hormones) supporting that their minds aren't fully developed </argument> and <argument> that they're incapable of certain higher processes regarding emotional awareness </argument>. Also <argument> I was careful to say that psychosis was a developmental disorder </argument>, and <argument> that teenage reasoning only appears quasi-psychotic, but that it's not </argument>, in explaining how people think emotionally and why in a way you could understand.

<argument> And you can understand it, and do; which is why you're pissed </argument>.

  <claim> I didn't tell you to change your view because you're inferior </claim>, and <argument> I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why </argument>, <argument> which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences (which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why </argument>. Don't try and punish me for talking to you.

&gt;<quote>As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense. There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments </quote>.

Name one.

&gt;<quote> You completely circumvented every single debate being had in this thread and proceeded to ejaculate your rather arrogant assumptions all over the place </quote> 

  <argument> If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else, yeah </argument>. <claim> I think you're describing your feelings of how all the other posts were dwarfed in your opinion and are in my post's shadow, and how you hate it </claim>. I like the implied sexual dominance part. I'll take the ejaculating comment and agree on that. I really did pound your thread pretty hard with thoughts, and I liked it.

&gt;<quote> It seems that you can barely fathom that you *may* be wrong, that you are too intelligent to have to provide any adequate reasoning for yourself </quote>.

  <claim> Well my post was about being wrong as an asset to learning things </claim>, but let's not spit hairs. <argument> Yeah it's pretty important to not think what you think is wrong </argument>. <argument> There's not a lot of sense in thinking things you don't think are true </argument>.

On the contrary to the Dunning-Krueger effect you are implying that I face, I am very critical of myself and feel incompetent in areas where others rate me as competent. I have not said a single thing in this thread that i've been absolutely sure of </quote>

<claim> Most folks don't claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them </claim>. At least enough confidence to have the gull to say it. <argument> If you came up and said you hated black people I'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too </argument>. <argument> Not exactly humble beliefs, are they </argument>.

<argument> See, no emotional awareness </argument>. <argument> Harvard study. My posts. Read them </argument>. <claim> You don't understand the signals you're sending, and get upset when folks read between the lines because you put the wrong information between them--likely true information </claim>. <claim> You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had, and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect </claim>. <claim> It's good that you've distanced yourself from your view in saying you're not that confident in it </claim>. It's one step closer to abandoning it.

&gt;<quote> Really, your argument is absolutely ludacris. It boils down to a well constructed shitpost </quote>.

<claim> Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond </claim>. I did anticipate this, and I'm not doing it to troll, but I really do want to change your view--more specifically, that sort of thinking. <argument> It'll go well with you to be smarter than that </argument>

<claim> I think it's working </claim>. <claim> I think your rage is death throes of a bad way of thinking </claim>. Enjoy it. <argument> People smarter than you have a nasty habit of being a little proud and avoid conflict, and will just judge you when you tell them stuff like that, instead of taking the time to tell you why you're wrong </argument>. <argument> Few people are willing to correct even false facts these days, let alone patterns and assumptions </argument>.

<claim> It's Dunning-Kruger </claim>. <argument> Also your view didn't anticipate the human element an iota </argument>, and <claim> that was a lapse in emotion that revealed your age </claim>. <argument> Once you learn what you don't know, you will have made a dent in knowledge akin to the damage a dove would do to a mountain if it few by lightly brushing it with the tip of its wing </argument>. <argument> In other words, it wouldn't be a drop in the ocean, so if you're squeamish about being ignorant you shouldn't have been born, because everybody is ignorant of most things </argument>. <argument> Fixing your thought patterns means you can be like an explorer who can take weirdness as it comes and be ready to deal with it, instead of having a tiff when you get called dumb for calling 55 million abortions a good thing with c.15 whole years of experience </argument>.

As for you, fix those thought patterns and get used to it, <claim> because you're going to readjust a lot </claim>. <claim> Best to find out how to deal with information instead of trying to be "right" </claim>, because <argument> sides are made by and for clergy and politicians, it wont do you any good </argument>.

  <claim> I didn't tell you to change your view because you're inferior </claim>, and <argument> I had the courtesy to explain what you missed and why, which did include a current inability to anticipate consequences (which is in the linked Harvard study) and how changing your view was a part of growing up and why </argument>. <argument> Don't try and punish me for talking to you </argument>.
           
  I'm not anticipating consequences? <claim> That was the entire point of my CMV </claim>. <argument> Did you not even read any of this? Did you not see the note that said that I was fishing for insight into the impact of 55 million abortions? </argument> <argument> You could have actually posed consequences to change my view </argument>.
  <argument> And Christ, you said you *had the courtesy to explain this to me*. Kid... </argument>
       
&gt;<quote>"As for your concluding paragraph, it is complete nonsense. There is an assumption every other sentence with the remaining sentences being filled with assertions that you have not been backed with well-founded arguments."
  &gt;**Name one.** </quote>
        
<claim> Anyway, that's why I gave that explanation, and you didn't anticipate it, but thought you did, didn't you? </claim> (1) <claim> You said I gave the Zeitgeist explanation because it was my best </claim> (2), but <argument> it was really tailored to challenge your reasoning style </argument>. <argument> You probably don't see yourself as having a predictable reasoning style(3) </argument>. <argument> This is the problem with X-factors and complexity(4) </argument>. <argument> You don't know what you don't know, you didn't know you didn't know my motivation, and you don't know that the 55 million abortions were a good thing (The point of the thread, no?), or what interests were operating in the establishment of them(The point of the thread, no?), or the consequences(The point of the thread, no?) </argument>. <argument> So far, the consequences are extremely negative for your generation(heck of a statement without an argument behind it) </argument>
          
&gt;<quote> If by that you mean I posted my own impressions like everybody else, yeah. I think you're describing your feelings of how all the other posts were dwarfed in your opinion and are in my post's shadow, and how you hate it </quote>.
         
  <claim> A little self important eh? </claim>
      
&gt;<quote> I like the implied sexual dominance part. I'll take the ejaculating comment and agree on that. I really did pound your thread pretty hard with thoughts, and I liked it </quote>.
        
  <claim> You seem to be quasi-psychotic </claim>
         
&gt;<quote> Well my post was about being wrong as an asset to learning things, but let's not spit hairs. Yeah it's pretty important to not think what you think is wrong. There's not a lot of sense in thinking things you don't think are true </quote>.
          
  <claim> Rambling on </claim>.               
         
&gt;<quote> Most folks don't claim to have extreme views unless they have an unhealthy degree of misguided confidence in them. At least enough confidence to have the gull to say it. If you came up and said you hated black people I'd also assume you were relatively confident about it, too. Not exactly humble beliefs, are they </quote>.
            
<claim> First of all, your comments, under your own description of the Dunning Krueger effect, have some serious ass Dunning Krueger </claim>. 
Second of all, <argument> I had reasoning behind my views, and was confident about the reasoning </argument>, but <argument> came here in expectance that there was some reasoning that I had not yet considered which may change my opinion </argument>. <claim> I came here to learn </claim>. <claim> I came here expecting myself to be proven wrong </claim>. <argument> You certainly weren't close to proving anything </argument>. 
    
&gt;<quote> See, no emotional awareness. Harvard study. My posts. Read them. You don't understand the signals you're sending, and get upset when folks read between the lines because you put the wrong information between them--likely true information </quote>.         
     
<claim> Having a thought, however morbid and efficient, is not enough to indicate a lack of emotional intelligence </claim>. <argument> People grow up learning different things, and get this, having different views </argument>. 
     
<argument> Then you go on to, instead of making an actual argument to prove me wrong, to say that I am not capable of holding these views without being inferior </argument>. 
    
<argument> Really, were you home-schooled </argument>? <argument> Your views are indicative of an angsty 20 year old who has not had much world exposure, one that wasn't weened until the age of 15 </argument>.
    
<argument> You also have special snowflake syndrome </argument>. <argument> All you do is sputter about whatever little information that you have while maintaining an illusion of superiority so that i'll trust how very *smart* you sound </argument>. <argument> I'm supposed to just accept your views without you proving them to be correct? </argument> <argument> This explains how long-winded you are, its apart of the illusion </argument>.
    
<argument> Also, your "Harvard studies, read them" was a pretty vain attempt of seeming more intelligent and of having more authority without adding anything new to the discussion </argument>.
   
&gt;<quote> You probably really do believe America is a better place because of the 55 million abortions its had </quote>
   
<argument> Read: post title </argument>.  
    
 &gt;<quote> and you probably see how shallow and dumb that is in retrospect. </quote>
      
<argument> 600 people would at least agree that it was an interesting thought. <argument>
     
&gt;<quote> It's good that you've distanced yourself from your view in saying you're not that confident in it. It's one step closer to abandoning it. </quote>
    
<claim> I'm not going to *abandon* a view, i'm going to be presented with new information that changes my mind. </claim>         
       
&gt;<quote> Most people would have thought that, and would have been satisfied to ignore you for this very reason and not respond. </quote>
      
  Oh? <argument> Then why is this post so popular? </argument> <claim> Again, instead of making actual arguments, all you're doing is to attempt to devalue me and the idea </claim> 
      
&gt;<quote> I did anticipate this, and I'm not doing it to troll, but I really do want to change your view--more specifically, that sort of thinking. It'll go well with you to be smarter than that. </quote>
     
  <argument> Visit the subreddit /r/iamverysmart to see your error </argument>
     
&gt;<quote> I think it's working. I think your rage is death throes of a bad way of thinking. Enjoy it. People smarter than you have a nasty habit of being a little proud and avoid conflict, and will just judge you when you tell them stuff like that, instead of taking the time to tell you why you're wrong </quote>. 
   
  <claim> You're one of those people you imply? </claim> <argument> See: Dunning Krueger </argument>.  <argument> Also, see the numerous other similar things you've said that don't actually contribute to the discussion, all you're doing is attempting to devalue the argument and myself. </argument>
      
&gt;<quote> Few people are willing to correct even false facts these days, let alone patterns and assumptions. </quote>            
     
<claim> Praise jesus! this intellectual has blessed me with correcting my false facts! I should be thankful! </claim>
                 
&gt;<quote> knowledge akin to the damage a dove would do to a mountain if it few by lightly brushing it with the tip of its wing. </quote>
            
<claim> Its like you say the same thing over and over again and make it as convoluted as possible </claim>
          
&gt;<quote> Fixing your thought patterns means you can be like an explorer who can take weirdness as it comes and be ready to deal with it, instead of having a tiff when you get called dumb for calling 55 million abortions a good thing with c.15 whole years of experience. </quote>         
  
<claim> Isn't this another one of those places where you were supposed to contribute to the discussion rather than doing your *i'm an intellectual* masturbation? </claim>
   
&gt;<quote> As for you, fix those thought patterns and get used to it, because you're going to readjust a lot. Best to find out how to deal with information instead of trying to be "right", because sides are made by and for clergy and politicians, it wont do you any good </quote>
   
  <claim> Ahh. I'm susceptible to politics and religion because I disagree with you. </claim> <argument> Bonus fedora points!! </argument>
