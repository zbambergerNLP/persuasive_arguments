As an independent form of study, philosophy doesn't seem to have any practical applications. What value does philosophy have in the modern age, right now, aside from contemplating things. Is it truly worth it to invest a significant amount of time and money studying this field? 

There do not seem to be any tangible applications or appreciable benefits from studying philosophy aside from personal growth and the expansion of one's intellectual perspective, which I argue can be gained without studying philosophy in a rigorously academic manner.  

I often have read the argument that it is impossible to argue that philosophy is useless without using philosophy, or something along those lines.

I acknowledge this. Yes, I am engaging in the use of philosophy right now, at this very moment. However, this does not provide an argument as to why it would be worthwhile to STUDY philosophy. 

What do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection? 

Certainly, important tools have originated from philosophical study, such as the scientific method, and science could be described as a subset of philosophy itself but that isn't an argument against the lack of tangible benefits to be gained from studying philosophy.

You don't need to study philosophy to become a capable scientist. You shouldn't need to study philosophy to cultivate a reasonable set of moral principles, or to be thoughtful about the circumstances and situations you encounter in your life. 

EDIT: I didn't expect so many answers! I'll try to read them all before I get too tired.

How is that *not* an argument against the lack of tangible benefits to be gained from studying philosophy? Philosophy spawned science, math, computing, ethics, most political philosophies, etc... Depending on how you define "tangible benefits", I guess you could make a weird argument that it doesn't have any, but only because as soon as philosophy produces tangible benefits, it gets spun up into its own field. I see philosophy as sort of an incubator program for other disciplines, which has proven super valuable in the past, and so I don't see any reason to suspect that this will necessarily stop being the case.

If you aren't studying philosophy to eventually continue into a career in researching philosophy, which few people do, IMO, what is the value?

Hmmm... Maybe I misunderstood. Are you arguing that philosophy as a discipline is useless, or merely that many/most people who get philosophy *majors* are wasting their time?

I wasn't clear, sorry. Perhaps more of the latter. I mean to ask what the average person can gain from studying philosophy. 

The benefits are immediately obvious from fields such as Computer Science or Engineering, or even arts and humanities as from all of those, you gain skill sets which all have their own arguable economic viability.

Gotcha. Well, I'd argue that I would expect a someone with a philosophy degree to have a relatively high capacity for general reasoning, thinking critically about a wide range of ideas, exposure to different ideas, and should be good at communicating these ideas, especially in writing. A philosophy major isn't the only way to get these skills, but as an employer I would be expecting philosophy majors to be above average in these capacities.

I also think its interesting that you mentioned computer science, which although it serves as the academic gateway to cushy software engineering jobs, most of *computer science* is super theoretical and abstract and not terribly useful in industry, while there's a boatload of valuable software engineering skills that my CS degree barely mentioned that had to be learned in the field. My point is that for both philosophy and computer science (which have a surprisingly large overlap btw), the degrees have high value as a signaling method to employers, but in both cases the "skills" you learn are very abstract and often not immediately practical. The value comes from the empirical fact that these programs have a history of producing smart and capable people.
