<title>CMV:Essential Oils are bullshit</title>

<OP author="GoldenTaint">
My wife has recently gotten deeply involved/obsessed with the healing properties of essential oils.  I am cursed with a common problem in that I am an extremely skeptical person.  I can't help but look at this product and see a pyramid scheme that takes advantage of the gullible.  All the shit my wife watches on these oils is carefully worded to make sure they don't make actual healing claims, I'm told this is because they aren't FDA approved and could get in trouble.  I've looked a little and haven't found anything debunking these oils but i still cannot help but feel they are total BS.  I would love to get more information from unbiased sources on this.  

Please change my view without just anecdotal testimonies.

I can't speak to your wife's particular situation. It seems likely that the business she's getting involved with is BS. Health and medical claims being slyly implied are almost certainly BS.

But the oils themselves are a legitimate part of perfumery, candle making and a number of honest crafts that value nice smells.

Thanks for the comment, but I'm afraid you are only strengthening my view on this.
