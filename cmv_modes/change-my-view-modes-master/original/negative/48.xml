<title>CMV: Irony aside, most people that post in CMV are uneducated, and changing their view on one point won't solve this overall problem</title>

There are some instances, yes where controversial topics are discussed here and people are actually interested in hearing the opposite side. I consider myself one of those people, and was initially driven to this subreddit in the hope that I would meet other people like myself that were posting here to educate themselves. The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.

But far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday's [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.

And the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.

Additionally, the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already, even before submitting. Go ahead, think of something you believe that is controversial and click "Submit CMV." Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this: it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.

Thanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post, albeit maybe not today, and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.

Quick edit: I realized I didn't address the second part of my title claim. Albert Einstein said that 2 things are limitless: the universe and human stupidity. For every stupid person that posts on this sub to address one point of their lack of knowledge, there are foreseeably dozens more points of misunderstanding that remain. What is the overall aim of this subreddit? To educate one at a time, indeed. But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed. This is a real debate: anything else is just convincing a stupid person of something that they fail to understand.

Subjectively, when I read through comments on CMV threads I see a lot of comments (and even initial views) that appear to be poorly thought out. What bothers me most of all are the broad statements that don't take into consideration the need for objective data, larger sample sizes, and real statistics derived from the actual data as opposed to anecdotal experience. Unfortunately, your view contains a similar sweeping statement. 

&gt;CMV: Irony aside, most people that post in CMV are uneducated....

This is purely anecdotal speculation. You don't have any real numbers on the educational background of CMV redditors. You can't make the blanket statement "most people" anything without those kinds of data. How much is most? 51%? How did you figure that number out? The simple fact is we cannot do so due to the anonymity of this site.

True, I have not statistics to back up this point, but I think that you would be hard-pressed to find a person that frequents this sub that also says that the vast majority of posts seek to discuss controversial topics rather than simply answer a question to which the answer already plainly exists.

Plenty of posts that have answers that plainly exist can still be controversial. Even though answers exist to questions about global warming, uneducated laymen may not know them. And let's suppose you are correct and these are mostly uneducated people posting things like "I don't believe in climate change" or what have you. Then how is it a bad thing that there is a discussion thread with people providing evidence to the contrary? Even if you don't change their view, people who know the facts will provide evidence. People who don't will read the thread. Again, you don't have numbers on how many of their views are changed. How many views have to change until its worth it?

This is not the kind of thing I am talking about. I said in the main body that widely controversial issues should be allowed.
