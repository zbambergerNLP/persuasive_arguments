I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not "blaming" the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a "worthwhile endeavor" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and "explaining causation" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as "part 1" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term "causation" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that "avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that "explaining causation is not victim blaming", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think "explaining causation" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

Part 1:  In principle I agree with you, but practically I think victim blaming is more prevalent and a larger problem than not explaining causality enough is. 

Part 2:  In the context of violent crime, I don't think it is worthwhile for people to restrict their behaviors for their safety.  Sure, if you and your friend walk through the dangerous area and no one else does, you could get mugged.  But if people in general stopped avoiding that area, the people perpetrating the crimes would not be able to keep up, and might get caught or stop mugging due to the larger number of witnesses.  That area or that time of day could cease to be dangerous, giving everyone greater freedom.  

This is also relevant to public efforts to make your city safe.  If efforts are focused on making sure that someone following the mugging-imposed curfew is safe, and everyone follows the mugging-imposed curfew, then people consider things to be ok, despite things not being ok because you are now living under a curfew. 

I have not lived in a city with any reputation for violence, though, so feel free to tell me I don't know how mugging works.

I agree that victim blaming is probably a larger problem than not explaining causality enough. I didn't intend to suggest that people weren't explaining causality enough; rather, I was arguing that explaining causality doesn't entail "justifying the outcome".
