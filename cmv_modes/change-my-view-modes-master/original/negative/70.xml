For those of you who don’t know, it’s common (at least in the US) for businesses, transit agencies, etc. to give small discounts to military veterans to thank them for their service.

It seems that medical responders (even hospital staff, actually) and other emergency services do more good for society than soldiers and that such discounts should be given to them.

As for the “They’re not risking their lives for our country.” argument, police officers do that too, and for citizens rather than the country and its interests. Some might argue that soldiers do the US a disservice rather than help, but that’s [usually] the fault of their leaders and therefore not relevant to the debate.

I’m really hoping there’s a good reason behind the status quo, but we’ll see. [It looks like there’s even less reason behind it than I initially thought, actually.]

[[My view’s been changed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rexe3/cmv_emts_sar_firefighters_police_etc_should/cnfj9cu?context=10000) In summary, I think that EMS people are just as deserving of these discounts (and that many more people contribute enough to be placed in the same category), but I now believe - for the same reason - that these discounts shouldn’t be offered at all.]

No they should not. Those people are civilians with full civil rights and in the case of police, are in a privileged position with regard to the law.

Military personnel make substantial sacrifices and frequently live in poor conditions. While I disagree with the hero fetish that is popular these days, I understand and support discounts for military personnel.

Also, note that EMS personnel are frequently employes of private corporations.

I’m not sure how sacrificing rights makes them more deserving of such discounts. After all, rewarding people for suffering rather than production is what the commies do[!]

Not sure where you got your idea of communism, but ok.

Note the irony punctuation. It was a joke based on Rand’s criticism of loving people for their flaws (I haven’t seen this happen outside of *Atlas Shrugged*.) and the stereotype of the militaristic, commie-hatin’ ’Murican.
