American patriots have a general mentality against immigration. Saying these people shouldn’t be allowed to become part of the country, is the same as saying they are worse, because they were born on a different side of a line, and americans are better because of the side of the line they are born on. This is prominent in many ads and political champagnes, namely the slogan “Creating jobs for americans”. I understand why politics use this slogan, because they are trying to get americans to vote for them, but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations. As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries. The companies launching these ads may be trying to win in the american market, so they can sell more of their product, but the fact that this can increase sales shows that many americans hold the being born on one side of a line belief. I am not blaming the politicians or corporations running ads running these slogans, they are merely trying to win votes or make money from this mentality, but really it is the citizens that have the belief that they are better, because of the side of a line they are born on, that are at fault. Patriotism is really just this belief.

I would define patriotism quite simply as supporting one's country, but not *necessarily* disparaging others. Therefore I would say that the antithesis of patriotism is not having a global perspective, but is in fact selfishness. Someone who attempts to extract gain for themselves at harm to their overall country is acting unpatriotically, someone who assists another country that is in worse shape instead of assisting their own can still be a patriot, but also recognize significant need in other nations and decide to assist them as well. Whether you support immigration or not, so long as you are supporting what you believe is best for your nation, you are still acting patriotically, and even if you decide to support another nation you can still be acting patriotically as well so long as you support your nation too.

This is true, but, I think, supporting the common good is also more important than supporting your country.

Yes, but the two are often one the same, especially when you live in a country as large as the U.S. most acts which serve the common good generally support your country.
