*Note: Please assume that there is no afterlife when responding to my post. I am not religious. Thank you. ALSO: By "meaningless," I mean "meaningless" to the person who is doing the dying. To the person who is alive and who will then die, life is meaningless. 

CMV. Assuming there is no afterlife, life is ultimately meaningless and pointless because we die. Death is the great eraser. Living life is as irrational as reading a book that, after finished, is immediately erased from your memory. It is comparable to that, too. 

It makes no difference if I, a 23 year old, die now or live until I am 100 and die. Either way, after my brief spark of existence I become nothingness. Not only do I remember nothing; I AM nothing. To me, it is as if my life had never happened. 

I'll put it another way. Imagine the time before you were born. Have you remembered it yet? Of course not. You didn't exist. This is the state that we return to after death--a state of nothingness similar to the state we were in before birth. When I die, I return to this state after a brief period of consciousness, and I return to it permanently. I might as well have never lived. 

To anticipate a few responses:

(1) Helping others doesn't matter. They will die too. And then their descendants will die, on and on and on, until eventually the universe is destroyed or our galaxy collapses in an inevitable heat-death. Even if 1,000,000 people were helped by me, assuming they all die, then my life is still pointless and meaningless. For I will be dead and won't know what I did, and once they die, they won't know either. 

(2) Attaining fame doesn't matter and doesn't truly make me "immortal." I'll be dead, and again, death is nothingness. Thus, I won't be around to enjoy my fame. 

(3) Enjoying the moment is possible, but doesn't make life have a point. For once I die, all memories and all point is gone. 

Please change my view from this depressing sentiment.

Because I don't disagree with your underlying view--that one's life becomes meaningless upon death--I think the relevant view to be changed is that this is a "depressing sentiment." 

Indeed, it should be viewed as an empowering and encouraging sentiment. As Carl Sagan so eloquently stated, "Life is but a momentary glimpse into the wonder of this astonishing universe...." The fleeting moments that we do have are the meaning of life, i.e., to live. 

To borrow your book analogy, I would much rather read the book--who knows how long the book will last, what characters and relationships will pop up, and what turns the story will take. Whether it was "meaningless" to have read the book once it's over doesn't mean that you shouldn't read the book in the first place. After all, the book isn't over yet, and you can still enjoy the story. You won't even know that the story is over (or that you don't remember what you read) because you'll be dead. 

There is only one thing we say to Death: "Not today!" So live your life and create your own meaning because once it's over, it's over.
