I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view:
1) Explaining causation is not "blaming" the victim.
2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.

I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)

Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.

On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)

The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.

Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.

Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged. 

I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.

EDIT: Fixed a sentence.


EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a "worthwhile endeavor" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and "explaining causation" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion. 

As far as "part 1" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term "causation" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that "avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that "explaining causation is not victim blaming", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think "explaining causation" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that. 

At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.

We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behaviour prevented us from getting mugged again.

In your case you examined the causation and were fortunate enough to be in a position where you were actually able act upon it. 
But for people who live in that area, have loved ones who live there, people who work there or go to school there or have no reasonable option but to walk through that area at certain times of the day: what would you have them do? How is you telling them “well, I was able to change my behaviour and it’s prevented me from being mugged again” in any way a worthwhile endeavour? I'm sure if you repeated your above quote to them, they'd be *super* appreciative. 

Yeah, I’m going to use the “P” word (sorry!) but your point of view comes from a position of (small p) privilege. You are fortunate enough to have a workable solution – not everyone else will be and having causation repeated to them over and over again isn’t exactly helpful for them, it’s demoralising and endlessly frustrating. 

For a real-life example, there was a news story from Montreal a few months ago regarding a spate of sexual assaults in taxis. The police warned women to not [use taxis alone](http://www.ccla.org/rightswatch/2014/10/16/montreal-police-criticized-for-advice-to-women-in-response-to-taxi-assaults). Which is super easy for the cops to say when they aren’t the ones who would be most affected by not using taxis alone. It might be fine for some people, but it kind of sucks if, say, you’re a young woman who works in a bar at the other side of town and your only other option is walking home at 3am on a Saturday night. What do you have her do? Just not go to work for weeks on end? 

Explaining causation can be useful if you have the option to readjust. But for people who have no other realistic options: what would you have them do? 

Telling a turkey that is isn’t a good idea to be a turkey in November doesn’t help the turkey very much.

That's a good point. You shouldn't apologize for bringing up privilege, as it's absolutely applicable. I don't live in these high-crime or dangerous areas, so it's easier for me to avoid them. If it means not walking by myself late at night, that doesn't impact my livelihood. So that's very relevant.

I am reconsidering the latter of my two points, which is that it's a worthwhile endeavor. Specifically: it's not always worthwhile to explain causation to someone, because many times they know already and cannot change the situation (maybe they work or live in an unsafe area, etc.). Do you think it's a worthwhile discussion to have in general, though? Like when people say things like "we need to have a societal conversational about X"? I just feel like the victim blaming issue is such a sensitive topic, it makes it difficult to have intelligent conversations about it without causing offense.
