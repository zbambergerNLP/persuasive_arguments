<title>CMV:Essential Oils are bullshit</title>

My wife has recently gotten deeply involved/obsessed with the healing properties of essential oils.  I am cursed with a common problem in that I am an extremely skeptical person.  I can't help but look at this product and see a pyramid scheme that takes advantage of the gullible.  All the shit my wife watches on these oils is carefully worded to make sure they don't make actual healing claims, I'm told this is because they aren't FDA approved and could get in trouble.  I've looked a little and haven't found anything debunking these oils but i still cannot help but feel they are total BS.  I would love to get more information from unbiased sources on this.  

Please change my view without just anecdotal testimonies.

In the scientific sense, 'essential'  literally means having an essence, in other words having a smell. Essential oils are plant extracts that contain the aromatic compounds of that plant. 

The healing properties are most definitely BS, other than smelling nice and helping you relax they have no proven benefits. 

Some might have minor positive effects, for example menthol or mint extract clears the nose and sinuses but that's about it.

Seems to me that the "healing effects" work just like placebos.
