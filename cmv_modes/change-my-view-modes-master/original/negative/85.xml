Bill Gade presents the argument better than I do so I will just quote him.

&gt;There have been 4 jobs or activities which Man has engaged in throughout the centuries: Hunter/Gathering, Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. What's next? What category can you imagine in which billions of people will be working in the future?
&gt;
It turns out that there is a final category. It is known as Unemployment. As Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services become more efficient in the coming months, workers will have nowhere to go but to the unemployment line. At some point, Man's artificial economic system will necessarily collapse. When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man.
&gt;
The current jobless situation you read about in the news is not an ordinary part of the business cycle. It is the final stretch of the linear trend that began with the birth of our species.

There is also a Youtube video to go with this opinion. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlQrYCacrKo&amp;spfreload=10

I do realize that this is a very unhealthy idea to have whether or not that the idea is true or not, I just have not been able to beat it myself.

I do disagree with Gade a little bit. I don't think it would kill everybody, but the some few people that still know how to hunt and gather would probably survive as well people who were rich enough to have access to a lot of resources to start out with before the economy crashes. I probably believe this because I listen to Alex Jones too much.

&gt;Which one? Why is the end of our current economic paradigm not followed by a new one?

The reason that the end of our current economic paradigm won't be followed by a new one is because there is nothing for us to do after the machines are doing all of the service jobs we are currently losing. Machines don't have money either so they won't bother buying services from us. Cryptocurrency may help a little because it would allow servers to be able to buy and sell things, but once they can administrate their own systems what is the use of humans.

&gt;&gt;When that happens, the corporations which produce and deliver food will no longer have an incentive to do so. The cities will suffer great hunger and it will be the end of Man.

&gt; Yes food shortages would be difficult in a city but if it got that bad why wouldn't people just leave the city and form small communities that farmed their own food? Why would it be the end of man?

What would be stopping them is the people already in the commutes they would try to go to. If the urban folk get rid of the rural folk the urban folk will just die due to their lack of skills. They couldn't just survive together because the ecosystem will not be able to sustain the amount of people. The rural folk can survive without the urban folk but their standard of living will plummet due to lack of infrastructure.
