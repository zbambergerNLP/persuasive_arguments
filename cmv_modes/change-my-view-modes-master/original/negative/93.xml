According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken. Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature. Let's call it X. Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken, but at some point it does. An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg. The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist. Am I wrong?

PS I'm playing laser tag soon so I will respond in 20ish minutes.

The modern domestic chicken is a hybrid of a red and grey junglefowl. The egg produced by cross-breading the two species resulted in the first chicken. Therefore, you are correct in saying that the egg came first, but your explanation is incorrect.

Interesting. I didn't know that. You may have just solved thus debacle. Where in the world did the chicken first live?

It's generally thought they originated in Asia -- India or Southeast Asia, most likely.
